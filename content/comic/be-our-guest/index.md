What an expensive bit of therapy. The engineer in me is crying.


Hope everyone is enjoying Warlords so far! I know both Vid and I are LOVING all the new lore, familiar faces, and overall storyline. And GARRISONS! Oh my god, the garrisons. What more needs to be said. Now if you’ll excuse me, I think it’s almost time to send my followers out on today’s missions.
