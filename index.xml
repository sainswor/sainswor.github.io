Next Up Search bar: Vid had mentioned wanting a search bar for the comic and that sounds like a great idea. I think this involves retrofitting the comics that don&amp;rsquo;t have tags, with tags.</description></item><item><title>And We Walked Out Once More Beneath the Stars, II</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/and-we-walked-out-once-more-beneath-the-stars-ii/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 09:54:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/and-we-walked-out-once-more-beneath-the-stars-ii/</guid><description>Five years ago today, FDWL ended its run. This feels fitting in a way, because the comic also ran for five years. If things had been different, maybe Mike and I wouldn‚Äôt even have remembered this milestone. Or we would‚Äôve and said, ‚ÄúHey, isn‚Äôt that neat.‚Äù Neither of us played World of Warcraft anymore, and this project had been largely lost because the original website was hacked and after a few years of not fixing it, I finally let the domain name lapse.</description></item><item><title>Reflections, Part Four</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/reflections-part-four/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2016 09:57:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/reflections-part-four/</guid><description>Five years ago, I thought of a joke that made me laugh. I turned the joke into a single comic featuring my character Vidyala and the character of my friend Rades (aka Mike). I sent it to him to see if he thought it was funny, and whether he might like to do more comics with me. After a lot of brainstorming (especially to come up with the name), From Draenor With Love was born.</description></item><item><title>Reflections, Part Three</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/reflections-part-three/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 10:38:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/reflections-part-three/</guid><description>And now, Four and Wrathion‚Äôs epilogues. We thought about it long and hard, and we really felt Four deserved a happy ending, living happily ever after in Ogri‚Äôla.
Wrathion, on the other hand‚Ä¶well, he‚Äôs got some thinking to do.

You didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd wrap up our story without making Vid draw her favorite orc one last time, did you??
If you don‚Äôt remember what Taran Zhu is referring to, it goes all the way back to the Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar trailer. Remember, the events of FDWL started when Siege of Orgrimmar began. And now, we examine the aftermath ‚Äî of both stories.</description></item><item><title>And We Walked Out Once More Beneath the Stars</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/and-we-walked-out-once-more-beneath-the-stars/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2016 09:57:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/and-we-walked-out-once-more-beneath-the-stars/</guid><description>Almost exactly three years ago, we published the first page of our revamped From Draenor With Love. That was so long ago. That was before Warlords of Draenor was even announced! It‚Äôs kind of surreal to even think about.
And now, 128 pages later, we‚Äôre drawing to a close.
When we set out on this journey, we wanted to explore some themes that we both hold close to our hearts: friendship and family.</description></item><item><title>Under the Mid-Point of That Other Sky</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/under-the-mid-point-of-that-other-sky/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2016 09:55:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/under-the-mid-point-of-that-other-sky/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Whose Shadow a Single Blow Pierced with Light</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/whose-shadow-a-single-blow-pierced-with-light/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2016 09:52:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/whose-shadow-a-single-blow-pierced-with-light/</guid><description>We‚Äôre a week into Legion, and all around me my guildies are talking about Suramar dailies, weird squid world bosses, reputation grinds, and other max-level concerns. Me, I‚Äôm still only level 107, so I‚Äôm just ignoring it all for now! Amusingly, somehow I‚Äôve reached 107 and finished only a single zone, Stormheim. Not via dungeon grinding, either! Just a lot of‚Ä¶meandering about, doing Darkmoon Faire quests, some pet battles, some Archaeology‚Ä¶everything but powerleveling, really.</description></item><item><title>The Ravening Beast</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-ravening-beast/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 09:58:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-ravening-beast/</guid><description>So how was everyone‚Äôs Legion launch experience? Me, I got myself trapped in the underbelly of an Alliance airship with no way out except for hurling myself out the open hatch to the sea below. Then I abandoned the breadcrumb quest into Stormheim to redo it and take more screenshots, but instead ended up stranded out there with no quests available. Then I hearthed back to Dalaran and broke my Tailoring profession quest by doing exactly the same thing.</description></item><item><title>Alone in a Dark Wood</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/alone-in-a-dark-wood/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2016 09:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/alone-in-a-dark-wood/</guid><description>Hey, nice job Kynrind on predicting the return of Vid‚Äôs symbol in the comments last week! üòÄ

And I think most of us would tend to agree with much of what she‚Äôs saying. The Horde and Alliance really DO just keep screwing everything up, and both sides are too damn dumb to cooperate and play nice. After all, From Draenor‚Äôs entire whole story is about trying to fix one of our bigger blunders, and restoring the Vale. Sure, Garrosh might have been the one who did the deed, but let‚Äôs face it, Pandaria was doing pretty good on the whole ‚Äúcontrol the Sha by controlling your emotions‚Äù thing before we washed up on shore.</description></item><item><title>Overconfident</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/overconfident/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 09:55:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/overconfident/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Happy Noblegarden!</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/happy-noblegarden/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 09:53:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/happy-noblegarden/</guid><description>Happy Noblegarden, everyone!

Wrathion seems to think he‚Äôs eliminated the rest of the Black Dragonflight‚Ä¶but we know he‚Äôs missed at least one.
When we were planning out the FDWL storyline, Wrathion meeting Sablemane was one of our major plot points. And I‚Äôve had the above image in my head ever since, of a totally out-of-his-element Wrathion in Blade‚Äôs Edge, gazing up in frozen shock at those iconic stone spires and impaled black dragons overhead.</description></item><item><title>Guest of Honour</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/guest-of-honour/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2015 09:46:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/guest-of-honour/</guid><description>That wraps up Chapter Four!

Speaking of Wrathion, I sure am curious what we‚Äôll see of him in Warlords. I believe his only appearance so far takes place ‚Äúoff-camera‚Äù, mentioned in Admiral Taylor‚Äôs Garrison Log, which doesn‚Äôt really tell us much.

One of the side benefits of being friends with WoW players who a) passionately roleplay draenei; b) hate orcs; c) all of the above, is that when it comes time to write a Broken character who has a huge hate-on for orcs, I have a huge selection of angry dialogue samples ready-made to pull from. üòâ

For those unfamiliar with what Rades is talking about, he‚Äôs referring to the fact that Rexxar, Vol‚Äôjin and Chen are old war buddies. Years ago (in Warcraft III) they fought together, for Thrall‚Äôs Horde, against the then-leader of Theramore, Daelin Proudmoore (Jaina‚Äôs father), who hated the Horde and wanted to respark the Horde-Alliance war. Considering the situation and players involved in the Siege of Orgrimmar, it seems a bit of a similar situation.</description></item><item><title>Let‚Äôs Make a Deal</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/lets-make-a-deal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 02:59:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/lets-make-a-deal/</guid><description>Does anyone actually go back to Gezhe each month and get their monthly Membership Benefits?

One of the most interesting things about writing FDWL is discussing scenes, and realizing how the events in the comic are letting us establish little character traits about Vid &amp;amp; Rades.

If you look at official WoW artwork, there are TONS of different draenei sigils/symbols depicted. Why ARE they different? Do they represent different magical abilities? Or is it like we‚Äôve described here, something biological, like an individual‚Äôs unique DNA footprint?

I worried how recognizable Zangarmarsh would be in black &amp;amp; white, without those soft, tranquil shades of blue ‚Äì but I suppose those giant mushrooms are pretty distinctive.

The impact of Garrosh‚Äôs actions in the Vale. Major events are about to be set in motion.
Apologies for the disarray of the site design right now. We updated the WordPress version and it broke everything, just like it ALWAYS DOES (seriously, it actually breaks every time we update) but thankfully the damage doesn‚Äôt seem TOO severe this time. Hopefully it shouldn‚Äôt be too long before we get everything back to how it should be.</description></item><item><title>Chapter One: Despair</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/chapter-one-despair/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 14:06:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/chapter-one-despair/</guid><description>It‚Äôs an exciting day for From Draenor With Love! After nearly two years of making this comic, we felt we were ready to tackle some new challenges.
What does this mean? Our name is staying the same. The comic will still be about Rades and Vid. It will be an ongoing story from week to week. The format will be less static four-panel and more graphic novel. I also made some changes personally, going back to my roots a bit as it were to ink the comic by hand rather than entirely digitally.</description></item><item><title>The Siege of Orgrimmar</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-siege-of-orgrimmar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2013 07:49:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-siege-of-orgrimmar/</guid><description>Patch 5.4 is almost here! I‚Äôm totally pumped, but I‚Äôm also dreading it! I want to see the cool new raid content and bosses, but I don‚Äôt WANT to kill Nazgrim! I don‚Äôt WANT to kill the Paragons!
And I don‚Äôt want to kill Garrosh!
(He‚Äôs a major From Draenor With Love character, after all!)
Speaking of the comic, this strip marks an important milestone for us. Starting next week, everything is changing!</description></item><item><title>Behind the Scenes Part 3: Production</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/behind-the-scenes-part-3-production/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 08:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/behind-the-scenes-part-3-production/</guid><description>For a larger version of today‚Äôs strip, click here.
This is part 3 of 3 of our Behind the Scenes series! Next week we‚Äôll have something‚Ä¶suitable, for the looming 5.4 patch. And then after that it‚Äôll be SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW AND EXCITING!

Everyone‚Äôs busy preparing for patch 5.4 and the Siege of Orgrimmar, and we‚Äôre no exception! We‚Äôre working on some significant changes to FDWL that you can expect to see when the patch goes live. For now, we thought we‚Äôd share a bit of the creative process and show just how we do this comic thing!</description></item><item><title>The Real Twelve</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-real-twelve/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2013 09:02:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-real-twelve/</guid><description>Hey, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much of a stretch! Rades is an accomplished engineer, he could undoubtedly keep a TARDIS running, and he could accomplish so much with a sonic screwdriver! I think Vid would make a great companion, though she could be the Doctor just as easily.
I did this art awhile ago and thought considering this Sunday‚Äôs announcement, using it now would be pretty timely. The opportunity to put Rades in a dapper suit jacket and bow tie was too good to pass up.</description></item><item><title>Dig Dug Bug</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/dig-dug-bug/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2013 11:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/dig-dug-bug/</guid><description>If it‚Äôs not a bind-on-account piece of gear to mega-buff alts, a fun vanity item to bust out during killshots, or hilariously unpredictable hearthstone replacements that randomly take you all over Azeroth, WE DON‚ÄôT WANT IT.</description></item><item><title>Tourist‚Äôs Guide to Ihgaluk Crag</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/tourists-guide-to-ihgaluk-crag/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2013 10:27:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/tourists-guide-to-ihgaluk-crag/</guid><description>Yet More Things To Do and See While in The Crag:

(And how long would it be before Razer released a special ‚ÄúGaming Tablet‚Äù for the truly hardcore?)

That all makes sense. And if we have to take out a few Kor‚Äôkron Commanders or Goblin Mercenaries while we‚Äôre at it? Sure. No argument here.
But the workers? What did they ever do to us? They‚Äôre just laborers! Red-collar working-class civilians. They‚Äôre just doing their 9 to 5, cutting up meat, chopping down trees, and suddenly we fly in on our giant cosmic dragons, beat ‚Äôem up, blow up their machines, and then take all their stuff.</description></item><item><title>There Are Two Types of People</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/there-are-two-types-of-people/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2013 08:05:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/there-are-two-types-of-people/</guid><description>The most difficult thing about this comic is that I had to stop playing ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing: New Leaf‚Äù long enough to draw it.
If you‚Äôre not familiar, ACNL is a kind of life simulator game for the Nintendo 3DS that has been sweeping through the WoW twitter community like a wildfire. I played an earlier Animal Crossing title on the Gamecube back in the day.¬†In terms of gameplay it‚Äôs pretty basic: Grow/harvest fruit, plant flowers, laugh at things your neighbours say, fish and catch bugs, dig up fossils, design clothes.</description></item><item><title>Whateverstone is More Like It</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/whateverstone-is-more-like-it/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2013 12:34:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/whateverstone-is-more-like-it/</guid><description>I‚Äôm not sure I know of a character in any book, movie or game who has had their personality and history thrown to the wayside and trampled into the dust as much as Garrosh has this expansion. I mean, in Cataclysm he certainly wasn‚Äôt perfect, but he had distinct good points to accompany his flaws, was a good character foil for his mirror image, Varian, and was showing definite signs of growth from his hotheaded, annoying days of being a mad dog yipping at Thrall during Wrath.</description></item><item><title>Can I Keep Him?</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/can-i-keep-him/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2013 08:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/can-i-keep-him/</guid><description>The big evil bad guys in WoW sure do like their pets, don‚Äôt they? It seems like every tier there‚Äôs at least one boss with special pets, or a boss that is itself a giant pet. Sometimes they‚Äôre just there, leaving their connection to the boss up to your imagination, but some, like Magmaw or Rageface/Riplimb, are outright stated to be pets. And some of them are really loved! Shannox loves his little doggies!</description></item><item><title>Nomi No-No</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/nomi-no-no/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2013 09:39:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/nomi-no-no/</guid><description>As many Pandaria chefs know, achievement.
However, to become Best Friends you have to go through a ton of cooking dailies with Nomi, where you give him some mundane cooking ingredients each day so he can practice his culinary skills. He then gives you back some Fish Jerky or some other junk.
Most people just sell the stuff to a vendor. But me? I don‚Äôt want his crappy food.
SO I DESTROY IT.</description></item><item><title>A Quick AFK</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/a-quick-afk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2013 18:24:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/a-quick-afk/</guid><description>This week in lieu of a comic we have instead a quick painting I did. I‚Äôve had family stuff come up that I had to deal with, it‚Äôs sad but sometimes life wins out. The average comic takes me around five+ hours to draw and unfortunately this week I didn‚Äôt have those hours. Back when we started FDWL they used to take me eight! I haven‚Äôt gotten that much faster, I have simplified the art significantly though.</description></item><item><title>The Proudmoore ‚ÄúProblem‚Äù</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-proudmoore-problem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2013 09:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-proudmoore-problem/</guid><description>A lot of people think Jaina has this terrible reputation regarding the men in her life, that she has ‚Äúterrible taste in men‚Äù, or that she breaks guys‚Äô hearts and/or makes them go crazy. This is utter nonsense. The problem isn‚Äôt with Jaina, the problem is that the men in her life are just plain jerks.

Would you like a small piece of art to call your own and remember all the good times you had at the convention? I‚Äôve been painting up just the thing!
These little paintings are painted on thick, high-quality Arches watercolour paper with Winsor &amp;amp; Newton watercolours.

I don‚Äôt even remember exactly, but weren‚Äôt they going for like 100 gold each? 100 GOLD PER TURNIP. And raiders who adamantly insisted they needed the best buff foods possible were crafting those banquets requiring 50 turnips at a time.</description></item><item><title>The Mogu Menace</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-mogu-menace/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2013 08:25:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-mogu-menace/</guid><description>Kill 10 Mogu. Kill 8 more Mogu. Hey guess what? Kill a dozen more.
I wonder just how many Mogu we‚Äôve taken out in our time here? All these Mogu-slaying dailies HAVE to be taking a toll on their population. Hell, I‚Äôve slaughtered a few thousand alone.
Kill Mogu for Valor, kill Mogu for reputation, kill Mogu because they‚Äôre in the way while doing Archaeology‚Ä¶name a reason, and we‚Äôve probably killed a Mogu for it.</description></item><item><title>Double Digits</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/double-digits/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2013 09:14:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/double-digits/</guid><description>I imagine tanks everywhere are shaking their heads in grim recognition of this scene.

Because EVERYONE KNOWS you can‚Äôt just WASTE A HOT STREAK PROC.

Saw a lot of people get insta-gibbed by those in LFR back during Cataclysm.
Then Elegon and his magic floor came and caused hilariously large quantities of surprise deaths, and I thought we had a new winner.
But then‚Ä¶came Durumu.
I can honestly say this was the first time I‚Äôve ever seen the entire LFR group instantly perish in the blink of an eye.</description></item><item><title>Desserter Debuff</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/desserter-debuff/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2013 08:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/desserter-debuff/</guid><description>At the end of March I was thrilled to be taking a trip to Toronto/Montr√©al because it meant I‚Äôd have the chance to meet lots of great WoW people I‚Äôd gotten to know online.

Seriously, there‚Äôs few things funnier than plopping down Blingtron in a hard-to-reach spot in a well-populated area and sitting back to watch people go MAD as they try to find that elusive free loot. My personal favorites include trees in Halfhill, the upper balconies in Pandalaran, or in the normally-inaccessible catwalk in Orgrimmar‚Äôs front auction house.

There‚Äôs been a lot of interesting raid boss mechanics ‚Äì vehicles, flying, spirit realms ‚Äì but few things are as satisfying or funny as just hauling off and punting a giant turtle at an even BIGGER turtle.

Poor clueless little Anduin. Hands up if you saw him step onto that platform covered in Sha magic and walk right up to Garrosh, and thought to yourself ‚Äúwelp, I have a bad feeling about how this is going to turn out.‚Äù AND SURE ENOUGH.
Should have listened to Dezco, kid.

Anyway, WE‚ÄôRE BACK! /blows kisses from amidst a sea of fluttering rose petals
The time off has been good to us and we‚Äôre ready to leap headfirst into all the exciting new 5.2 stuff! Let‚Äôs just hope we can remember how to do this comic thing! (Confession, it took me nearly 10 minutes to remember the WordPress login info.)

Like, literally, just sketching away and plop! it‚Äôs a scene right out of the Undercity. It‚Äôs all good though, she‚Äôs out talking to Mekkatorque right now about a steam-powered mechanical replacement. She says it‚Äôs no big deal, but as a veteran engineer, I remain skeptical.
But joking aside, the unfortunate reality is we‚Äôre starting to feel a bit of burnout, and there‚Äôs been some real-life commitments that are rearing their unavoidable and time-consuming heads.</description></item><item><title>You Know He Would, Part Two</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/you-know-he-would-part-two/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2013 12:23:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/you-know-he-would-part-two/</guid><description>The inevitable result of last week‚Äôs devious scheme.
(Really, this moment was so amazing, how could we NOT give it the full-comic spotlight it deserves??)
You know, in-game Garrosh is unpleasant and thoroughly unlikeable, and Blizzard is going to great lengths to portray him as an absolute monster. But I‚Äôm a big fan of THIS Garrosh, the one who isn‚Äôt concerned about world domination or wiping cities off the map, but just sticking it to Varian and being a general pain in the ass.</description></item><item><title>You Know He Would, Too</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/you-know-he-would-too/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2013 08:49:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/you-know-he-would-too/</guid><description>Still the highlight of the expansion so far, in my opinion.
Let‚Äôs be honest. How many of us re-did this quest, over and over again, just to repeatedly wallop Varian in his giant chin? Who could possibly resist??
Headcanon: Garrosh sitting down in his throne room with a paper and clipboard.
On the left-hand side of the page: Strong new allies. Much-needed boost to the Horde‚Äôs ranks.

Also, I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôve ever mentioned this, but we‚Äôre always open to ideas and suggestions!

Also, I just need to point this out while Rades is gone: Orcs are currently on the very naughty list.
But the idea of Velen as Greatfather Winter and the faction leaders as little kids was actually all Rades‚Äô, so you can‚Äôt accuse me of bias in this case.

If you‚Äôve been reading FDWL regularly since around May, you might remember this comic about Millya‚Äôs lost tail ring. Inspired by an unfortunate true story, it was around that time that I realized I had lost my wedding rings. We looked everywhere for them, upended everything, and ultimately concluded that they were lost forever.

Last Friday we went to a concert! It was great and we had a great time. But the guy sitting next to Voss was coughing the entire time almost nonstop.

Or when they‚Äôd summon 5-6 portals on top of one another and you‚Äôd have to click and see where you‚Äôd end up (Portal Roulette).
Or when they‚Äôd start casting you a portal, and then ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù just Teleport themselves back to Orgrimmar, leaving the rest of you stuck in some wretched abyssal lair, miles from home.</description></item><item><title>Don‚Äôt Even Blink</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/dont-even-blink/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2012 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/dont-even-blink/</guid><description>This comic will probably make the most sense to you if you are a mage, and/or if you have been a mage‚Äôs victim in this scenario. I have personally tallied my Blink kill count at probably four people. With Antigen it involved a rocket boots incident, with Itanya, we each headed the wrong way.

And of course, no longer prone to the excruciating frustration of attempting to summon a mage table ‚Äì for other people‚Äôs benefit ‚Äì only to have some oaf walk up and start summoning, but then wander away, cancelling the spell BUT still triggering the 10-minute cooldown.</description></item><item><title>Insert Emotion Here</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/insert-emotion-here/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2012 09:54:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/insert-emotion-here/</guid><description>When we wrote this joke in our script page three weeks ago, little did we know that the ‚ÄúSha of ____‚Äù joke would become so popular and so prolific before we had a chance to publish.

There really are unlimited possibilities when it comes to these other, lesser-known Sha.

The best part about this comic is how utterly unfamiliar both Vid and myself are with these themes. We‚Äôre about as un-thug-life as you can get.
Anyway‚Ä¶so uh, yeah. About those farms.
We can‚Äôt be the only ones making MAD BANK off our daily produce harvests, right? It‚Äôs absurd how much these pumpkins, turnips and melons are going for!

The Dread Wastes are so horrifically mutated and ugly (I personally think they feel like the Ghostlands, except on acid) and Walks totally nailed the vintage travel poster look. Thanks Walks! üòÄ
I think of all the factions in Mists, the Dread Wastes‚Äô Klaxxi are my favorite.

I‚Äôm not going to even TRY to suggest what you should be doing, because it‚Äôs ALL amazing and beautiful and completely awesome.

Jaina and Thrall have been friends since before he started calling himself Go‚Äôel. Asric and Jadaar are a pair of lesser-known but still significant ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù a blood elf and a draenei who seem to love to hate each other. Game mechanics prevent us from communicating with each other and they do an excellent job of keeping us divided.

Speaking of orc babies, Vid brought up an interesting question while doing the art ‚Äì what color skin would the baby of a green-skinned orc and a brown-skinned orc have? We settled on sort of an olive complexion, but only time will tell!

WTF is it with WARRIOR glyphs in Mists? Cripes. Lighting themselves on fire, lightning strikes, flocks of crows, and now MORE BLOOD? Blizz is sure giving them some pretty fun cosmetic options!
Also, these might seriously be my favorite type of strip. I don‚Äôt know if Vid was quite as big a fan of this particular one though.

It seems such a disproportionate reward, too ‚Äì you bring back proof of 250(!) kills and you get 10 little tickets.</description></item><item><title>To the Ground</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/to-the-ground/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Feb 2012 09:11:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/to-the-ground/</guid><description>The idea of class abilities repeating endlessly was actually really hard to make a comic for, because there were so many awesome options! The mental images of Healing Rain, Hurricane or Fan of Knives duplicating over and over again are too funny.
In the end, we decided to go with a theme preferred by Vid: CAKES (you can never have too much cake, according to her) and dead Warlocks. Also, the opportunity to have a sea of cakes was too great to pass up.</description></item><item><title>Every Day I‚Äôm Transmogging</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/every-day-im-transmogging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 10:09:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/every-day-im-transmogging/</guid><description>This may be my favourite FDWL in the history of ever. (I know, we‚Äôve only done less than 20 strips but even so!)
Usually the way we make strips is one of us has an idea and pitches it to the other, then we start to brain-storm and perhaps refine or change a few things. Sometimes the strip is fully formed, as when Rades presented this one to me like so:</description></item><item><title>Your Racial Leader is Thinking About You</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/your-racial-leader-is-thinking-about-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2012 09:24:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/your-racial-leader-is-thinking-about-you/</guid><description>It occurred to Vid and I yesterday that perhaps we should have saved the comic with the NAKED ORC for our Valentine‚Äôs Day update. Apparently we are unable to read calendars.
We figured we needed to do SOMETHING love-themed for this week ‚Äì after all, the comic IS From Draenor With LOVE!
Well, who better to feature on our special Valentine‚Äôs Day card than another local from Draenor, the Warchief himself!</description></item><item><title>Maximum Cupacity</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/maximum-cupacity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2012 10:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/maximum-cupacity/</guid><description>I really, really wish we had ampm stores in Canada. I would totally buy those cups! The art on them looks great, and they‚Äôd be nice collectibles to own.
The three ‚Äúrejected‚Äù cup ideas we came up with for this strip should all be sadly familiar to most WoW players. I don‚Äôt think anyone will EVER forget Sindragosa‚Äôs famous line, and Neptulon‚Äôs PUUUURE WATERRRR line from Throne of the Tides has quickly become a fan favorite.</description></item><item><title>Squeaky Green</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/squeaky-green/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2012 09:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/squeaky-green/</guid><description>When we heard that there would be no Blizzcon this year, Vid and I knew we had to cover it somehow. We ran down the list of Blizzcon cliches (true or not), one of which was the inevitable pungent result of cramming hundreds of bodies into a cramped, enclosed convention center.
Then, somehow, it became this.
To say Vid was mortified when I sent her the script would be an understatement.</description></item><item><title>Choose Wisely</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/choose-wisely/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2012 09:43:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/choose-wisely/</guid><description>Yes, we know Droids and Hutts are not actually available player races in SWTOR. Too bad ‚Äì I would totally be a Hutt so I could use awful HUTT YOUR MOUTH and HUTT UP puns and make everyone hate me.
Also, I wish I could say we were joking when talking about Vid‚Äôs overpowering love for anyone blue. Let‚Äôs just say that panel 4 isn‚Äôt entirely off the mark. üòâ</description></item><item><title>Magic Touch</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/magic-touch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2012 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/magic-touch/</guid><description>‚Ä¶Then I finally found a suitable mold for the chassis or I thought it was a suitable chassis mold but actually they meant it for a gyrocopter and it wasn‚Äôt quite right so I tried to convince a friend to model for it but he wouldn‚Äôt because he said, and I quote, ‚ÄúYour inventions have a way of proving fatal to people who agree to test them,‚Äù I ask you, is that fair?</description></item><item><title>Thrall, Aspect of Derp</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/thrall-aspect-of-derp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2012 11:04:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/thrall-aspect-of-derp/</guid><description>In the final fight of Dragon Soul, players have to fight Deathwing while leaping back and forth between a few different islands, carried by Thrall‚Äôs winds.
Unfortunately, Thrall has some‚Ä¶issues‚Ä¶and will occasionally NOT give a player the wind buff, which sends them plummeting to their death in the churning Maelstrom below. This usually results in much anger and frustration, and usually a wipe.
Is he just trolling us? Or is he just really, really incompetent?</description></item><item><title>Damn You, Murglesnout</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/damn-you-murglesnout/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2012 09:21:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/damn-you-murglesnout/</guid><description>Oh, Murglesnout. Fisher‚Äôs bane. So plentiful. So abundant.
So utterly, completely worthless.
True, Blizzard did eventually add in a Cooking recipe so that the dreaded Murglesnout wasn‚Äôt COMPLETELY pointless. But it‚Äôs TOO LATE! Even now, the mere sight of THIS TERRIBLE FISH fills me with rage. MURGLESNOUT!
‚Ä¶however, it really does make a fun ‚Äúgift‚Äù to give friends.
If you want to MAKE THEM ANGRY!
MURGLESNOUT!</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Four</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-four/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2011 12:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-four/</guid><description>I wasn‚Äôt actually sure how Rades intended to end our little odyssey. Needless to say, my jaw dropped when I got this far in the script. It‚Äôs great for him, though, because he gets to show his mad genius! Vid, who has no compunction about blasting a rocket straight into Ironforge or any other environs, is a little uneasy when it comes to FrankenWinter. But ultimately, she decides that it‚Äôs better to let a cyborg version of Greatfather Winter do all of the Winter‚Äôs Veil stuff ‚Äì so that she and Rades don‚Äôt have to.</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Three</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-three/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2011 02:40:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-three/</guid><description>Part 3 of 4! Rades and Vid do their best to fill the late Greatfather Winter‚Äôs shoes ‚Äì in their own, unique fashion, of course.
Locations where Vid is now no longer permitted to operate: The Exodar AND Ironforge.
Hey, isn‚Äôt that rocket in panel 4 the same type as the one that blew up Greatfather Winter? Oh well, what those Druids don‚Äôt know, won‚Äôt hurt them‚Ä¶hopefully.
Next week‚Äôs Part 4 will come out a few days after Christmas, so consider it our special (belated) gift to you for reading!</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Two</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-two/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-two/</guid><description>The saga continues! Oh no, poor Greatfather Winter!
Vid did an awesome job with the expressions in this strip, I think you‚Äôll all agree. I‚Äôm now using the ‚ÄúSad Rades‚Äù face as my avatar, and I can‚Äôt even look at panel 3 without laughing.
There was some debate about which Greatfather Winter to use ‚Äì the dwarven Alliance version, or the orcish Horde version! In the end though, we decided to go with the dwarf, to include more races.</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part One</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2011 07:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-one/</guid><description>It‚Äôs a cliche often used that ‚Äúthe journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.‚Äù In this case, a journey of approximately 17,500 miles per hour begins with a single rocket and a large explosion.
This is how engineers work.
Rades and I wanted to do something a little special and different for the upcoming holiday season, as well as try our hands at a mini story-arc! So expect this story to run for pretty much the rest of the month, until we reach its epic conclusion.</description></item><item><title>Transmogalypse</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/transmogalypse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/transmogalypse/</guid><description>Has there ever been a feature more eagerly anticipated than Transmogrification? If there is, I sure haven‚Äôt seen it. So many options! So much potential for nostalgia! The future has arrived, and its name is World of Dresscraft.
Of course, for every person who can‚Äôt wait to dig out their old Tier 1 or Tier 0.5 sets, there‚Äôs someone who is going to gleefully turn their fearsome, godly ‚ÄúI‚Äôm-About-to-Kill-Deathwing‚Äù armor into a neon nightmare Burning Crusade clown suit.</description></item><item><title>For Science, You Monster</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/for-science-you-monster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/for-science-you-monster/</guid><description>Hey guys, Vid‚Äôs been crit by real life this week, so send her warm thoughts because until she‚Äôs back, you‚Äôre stuck with my terrible WoW Model Viewer comics!
Last night Blizzard released an updated Mists of Pandaria talent calculator, complete with new baseline talents. One of the new baseline Warlock talents was Demonic Portal, as pictured above. Needless to say, the Portal comparisons were instant and furious! So I figured it was an appropriate time to break out ye old Undercity Companion Cube image from this year‚Äôs Love is in the Air seasonal event.</description></item><item><title>Yellow Angry Man</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/yellow-angry-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/yellow-angry-man/</guid><description>If you‚Äôve played a paladin at level 85 for any length of time, hopefully this requires no explanation. For those of you who haven‚Äôt, well. Perhaps you play a melee DPS. You‚Äôre at the boss‚Äô feet, stabbing/slicing/cutting (or whatever else it is that you melee folks do).
You hear an odd grunt.
‚ÄúARRRRGH!‚Äù
‚ÄúGRRRRRR!‚Äù
‚ÄúRRRRRAAA!‚Äù
This, my friends, is the Yellow, Angry Man. His anger knows no bounds. Likewise, his yellow-ness is unsurpassed.</description></item><item><title>Grudge Match</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/grudge-match/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/grudge-match/</guid><description>When the Pet Battle System was announced at Blizzcon, everyone had a wide range of reactions. Were they serious? Was this an elaborate joke? How much more like Pokemon could this possibly be? But without question, the most important possibility was the potential hilarity of absurd pet matchups, such as Alliance Balloon vs. Horde Balloon, or Enchanted Broom vs. Magic Lamp. Can you say EXCITEMENT??
Personally, I‚Äôm banking on my Toxic Wasteling.</description></item><item><title>Rare Spawn</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/rare-spawn-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2011 06:21:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/rare-spawn-3/</guid><description>I‚Äôm not especially good at keeping secrets. So the fact that you are only seeing this, now, after over a month of loving work is nothing short of a miracle. The idea of doing a webcomic wasn‚Äôt a new one for Rades and I ‚Äì we‚Äôd talked about it before, sometime last year ‚Äì but the time wasn‚Äôt right. We were on different pages about what a comic should be (I was thinking epic story, he was thinking gag) and so we just shelved it.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/about-us/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/about-us/</guid><description>Stacey is the author of Manalicious, a World of Warcraft blog about mages, guild leading, and heroic internet dragons.
