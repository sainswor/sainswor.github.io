comment: '<p>Ah so it was Broken!<br>It makes sense. Zangarmarsh and Nagrand are where they have their strongest concentration of people as I recall.</p><p>And no, they are certainly not as friendly as Nobundo, or even Akama.<br>Of the tribes that didn’t come back after Nobundo ended their exile I can see how many held bitterness towards the draenei that had cast them out, and outright hatred for the orcs that had helped twist them into their current forms.</p><p>Even the Kurenai are very wary of strangers as I recall and they are the friendliest of the lot. Will be interesting to see which tribe these belong to. If it’s Murkblood they are definitely in trouble.</p><p>I really like the leaves, leather and fur details on this trio btw. They definitely look like they live in the swamp.<br>Also, love the lighting in the panel where Vidyala makes her hammer flare with light.</p><p>Are the skulls from any specific animals or humanoids?</p>'
