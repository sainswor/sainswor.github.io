comment: '<p>From the look on his face, and what he is, I’d say he might be feeling like he’s looking into a mirror with her. All dragons make strange plans, but because he is a black dragon, few will trust HIS. From before he was out of his egg, the very people curing him never thought of him as more than a weapon, because of what he is. And when he wanted to forge his own destiny, after wiping out his own kind, the Red Dragonflight responded with a massive show of force.</p>'
