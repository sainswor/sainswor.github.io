Saw a lot of people get insta-gibbed by those in LFR back during Cataclysm.
Then Elegon and his magic floor came and caused hilariously large quantities of surprise deaths, and I thought we had a new winner.
But then…came Durumu.
I can honestly say this was the first time I’ve ever seen the entire LFR group instantly perish in the blink of an eye.</description></item><item><title>what</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/what/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/what/</guid><description>When Heart of Fear LFR came out, Garalon was…how shall we say…an interesting experience. And by interesting I mean painful, excruciating agony. It really became almost a joke that first week, to see how badly an LFR group would fail. And it’s not even necessarily people’s fault! Tag-team pass a kiting debuff back and forth with a stranger? And transmit it through touch? As in, the same mechanic that gave hardcore progression guilds migraines on Heroic Putricide back in ICC?</description></item></channel></rss>
