comment: '<p>As someone who’s been fairly critical of the writers in the past, I’ll eat crow and admit that Blizzard really hasn’t done better in terms of story or presentation than this expansion. The Classic/BC/Wrath worshippers can bemoan the lost community, but that isn’t something Blizzard can restore.</p><p>I do like the cameos from old expansions, although some of them don’t really make much sense. Given the militaristic battle the Blasted Lands was supposed to be, it just seems weird for people like Tommy Joe Stonefield or Milly Osworth (or even Fiona, for that matter, even though I like her) to stroll on through the portal to find jobs in Draenor. The recently-wed Firebeard couple at the stables made more sense.</p><p>I did have to play damsel in distress to Thrall in Nagrand, but if that is the extent of having to deal with the Aspect of Derp, I can get over that.</p>'
