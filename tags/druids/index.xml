Tragically, this bug has since been fixed and you can no longer pile druids to the heavens and walk around as a teetering tower of antlers and fur. Such a shame!
Was it supposed to work like that? Well, probably not. But my gosh, was it hilarious. Ah well, R.I.P. stag stacking.
If you never got the chance to see it in action, here’s a Youtube video.</description></item><item><title>The Legacy of Kip Diskin</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-legacy-of-kip-diskin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2012 08:18:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-legacy-of-kip-diskin/</guid><description>The new glyphs on the Mists of Pandaria beta sound amazing. Trust me, this is not the only glyph feature you’ll be seeing on From Draenor.
I was actually surprised to see an Orca glyph, since they seem more suitable for Northrend than the lush, temperate zones of Pandaria. Wouldn’t it be funny if there were a huge assortment of minor glyphs that changed the appearance of druid travel and aquatic forms?</description></item></channel></rss>
