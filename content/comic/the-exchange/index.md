You know what they say: Every ethereal has his price. 


And remember, these Ethereum guys, theyâ€™re way out of date on their gemstones! Cardinal Rubies, Amberjewels, Lapis Lazulis, Queenâ€™s Garnets, Primal Diamondsâ€¦weâ€™re talking like, three whole expansionsâ€™ worth of exciting new jewels to covet! What self-respecting ethereal could resist such an offer?  ðŸ˜‰


Next week will mark the end of Chapter 2! After that, weâ€™ll be taking a short break for some RL vacations and script planning, but weâ€™ll be back before you know it!
