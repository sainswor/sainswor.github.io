I really, really wish we had ampm stores in Canada. I would totally buy those cups! The art on them looks great, and they’d be nice collectibles to own.


The three “rejected” cup ideas we came up with for this strip should all be sadly familiar to most WoW players. I don’t think anyone will EVER forget Sindragosa’s famous line, and Neptulon’s PUUUURE WATERRRR line from Throne of the Tides has quickly become a fan favorite.


And the whole Tyrande/Malfurion thing? I think we all remember “Tyrande’s” faction leader artwork and story. But hey, at least Vid’s Tyrande cup doesn’t have back boobs.
