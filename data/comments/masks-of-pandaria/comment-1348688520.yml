comment: '<p>The very first thing I did post pandaland was teleport to theramore to see the position bug (you spawn at the exact same elevation as before, but part of the crater is there). While I was there I became very OCD, the center of the crater made no sense! It was closer to the armory, when it shouldâ€™ve been centered on the tower.</p>'
