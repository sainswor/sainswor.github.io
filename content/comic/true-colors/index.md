I just noticed this week that the Sargerei mobs in Shadowmoon Valley (and the [Sargerei Disguise](http://www.wowhead.com/item=119134/sargerei-disguise) toy) use a recolor of Sablemane’s outfit! The green and purple look’s not bad, but it doesn’t quite have the *zing* of Sablemane’s bright orange and red, in my opinion.
