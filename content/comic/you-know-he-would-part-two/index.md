The inevitable result of [last week’s devious scheme.](/comic/you-know-he-would-too)


(Really, this moment was so amazing, how could we NOT give it the full-comic spotlight it deserves??)


You know, in-game Garrosh is unpleasant and thoroughly unlikeable, and Blizzard is going to great lengths to portray him as an absolute monster. But I’m a big fan of THIS Garrosh, the one who isn’t concerned about world domination or wiping cities off the map, but just sticking it to Varian and being a general pain in the ass. 


Can’t you picture him cackling and giggling to himself like the Duck Hunt dog, after sending yet more face-punching-Pandaren recruits to Varian’s door? 


You’re such a brat, Garrosh.
