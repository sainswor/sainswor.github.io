And we’re back! 


Just a reminder that even though War Crimes just came out, and Garrosh’s trial is what’s “currently” happening, FDWL takes place during the Siege of Orgrimmar timeframe.


As for whether this is directly relevant? Well, let’s just say we’ve both got the book and are pretty curious to see what all happens.  😉
