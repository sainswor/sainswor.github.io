comment: '<p>I thought I remembered reading a WoW forum post stating that they weren’t changing the timeline, which means Warlords Draenor was in an Alternate Reality, and brought into ours when Kairoz did his thing, possibly with those stones from The Timeless Isle. Which would make sense, seeing as without Outland, Garrosh wouldn’t exist, or at least, not as we know him, and AR Garrosh wouldn’t know about Azeroth, and while Kairoz could still go to him, with the events so changed, I doubt he could before the universe pulled apart, so therefore, without AR Draenor, we would have one hell of a Paradox…</p><p>Whoops, sorry for the lecture. Anyway, what’s so special about Vidyala’s mark?</p>'
