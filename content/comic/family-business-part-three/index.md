One of my favorite moments in Mists of Pandaria was after youâ€™d completed Wrathionâ€™s Legendary questline and defeated Garrosh, when you return to the Tavern in the Mists and get to watch Wrathion throw a temper tantrum. I liked it because of Tong â€“ how he finally has had enough and steps in and reprimands Wrathion for his childish behavior. Or to be precise, I enjoyed it because this NEVER HAPPENS. 


Wrathion has, since he was introduced, always been the one full of confidence, fully in charge, always cocky and sure of himself. Yes, it makes him a very fun and memorable character, but I loved someone â€“ an INNKEEPER, of all people â€“ finally calling the Black Prince out.
