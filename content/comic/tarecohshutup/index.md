I knew from folks spending time in the beta that Dragonwrath had a new feature. Yet after 5.0.4 went live, it still scared the bejeebers out of me the first time she **talked out loud**. I tend to keep my volume up pretty high!


I don’t actually find Tarecgosa annoying in-game, I like the occasional interjections (but I have my sound turned down so low now that I seldom hear all the [things she says](https://www.wowpedia.org/Dragonwrath,_Tarecgosa%27s_Rest#Notes). But we thought that this feature had a lot of potential when carried to its eventual conclusion.


I’m going to miss my Dragonwrath when it becomes obsolete very soon. It’s earned a permanent place in my overstuffed bags! Consider this comic a last homage to a legendary after the [previous one](/comic/rage-of-the-friendlands).


(Aghh I can’t believe Mists is only a week away! The next FDWL you see will be post Mists launch!)
