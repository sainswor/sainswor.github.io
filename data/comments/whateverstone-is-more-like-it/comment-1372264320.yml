comment: '<p>I’ll give Blizzard some leeway when it comes to continuity/retcon gaffes concerning their earlier games. I mean, it’s been 18 years since Warcraft, I don’t think they really anticipated the huge world they have now. Things like Garrosh though, that’s super recent, so there shouldn’t be any such weirdness there!</p><p>A Raynor/Kerrigan romance though…that does seem like a pretty significant plot point to change, considering how important those two characters are.  :\</p>'
