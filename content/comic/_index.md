I'm working on this as a tribute to Rades. I miss him a lot.

I've got the basic plumbing worked out for everything except the calendar and the comments. I'm hoping to get those sorted out soon. The goal is to eventually have a faithful recreation of the original site (well, except that there's going to be a link to Hugo instead of Wordpress in the bottom corner), meaning eventually, instead of a note on what I've been working on, this will be the final page of the comic (the fourth page of the epilogue).

As of now, though, you're probably best off just going to [the start of the comic](/comic/rare-spawn-3).
