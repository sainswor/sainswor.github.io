comment: '<p>I kind of wondered if the whole female worgen fiasco hadn’t brought to their attention JUST how many women actually play WoW, and whether that isn’t why we’re *not* going after Sylvanas.  They totally botched femme worgens, sidelined Tyrande in the calendar, and got called out on both.  Perhaps they worried that making Sylvie the raid boss would be strike three in pissing off their female playerbase?</p><p>Personally, I’d love to take them both out.  I liked Garrosh a tiny bit better after questing through Stonetalon, but since on an “I like you” scale of one to five he started as a zero, that doesn’t take much.  Sylvanas was barely tolerable in Wrath, but in Cata she’s gone rabid.  They should both be offed, for my money.</p>'
