comment: "A year ago, my friend died.\r\n\r\nRades and I met through D&D, and I started the relationship by being very intimidated that this Famous Warcraft Person was going to be playing a game with me. He very quickly showed himself to be possessed of a lightning-fast, needle-sharp and hearth-fire warm wit. \r\n\r\nWe both had an intense interest in crafting a good story, in spinning a tale that would not just pique but outright seize the interest of the listener. He was very, very good at this, and I could never shake the feeling that I was trying to catch up. Sometimes, we’d hit on the same plot points one after the other. I don’t know that I ever told him, but I would always consider it a compliment that a plot beat I’d come up with was something he’d also struck on. To me, that meant I’d done well. If my story beats made him pause, I considered that a good sign. If they made him laugh, well, that was a genuine triumph. He had an infectious, warm, goofy laugh, and I don’t think I ever heard him force a laugh for something he didn’t find funny.\r\n\r\nIn the games we played together, my characters would often end up playing the straight man to his characters. I think that’s probably due to the enthusiasm he so often displayed. I thought then, and think now, that he only ever had two settings: \"Wildly enthusiastic and 100% present\" and \"asleep\". Certainly I never saw any evidence of any other style. It was just what he did, how he was; as uncompromisingly, shiningly himself as a candle-flame.\r\n\r\nThen, like that candle-flame, he was gone.\r\n\r\nDuring one of our last conversations, we were chatting with each other and a mutual friend, while watching our friend play a video game. I’d offered some advice, having played the game in question repeatedly and knowing quite a lot about it, and Rades had said \"Let him play it out himself,\" or words to that effect. I hadn’t meant to be overbearing or interfere with the player’s enjoyment, but I’m good at taking things in a negative light, and the words felt like a rebuke.\r\n\r\nThey were also, barring a joke he made about one of my characters, the last words we exchanged. When I learned that he’d died, my brain completely glossed over the joke, decided that the last conversation we’d had was on acrimonious terms, and it felt terrible. I wanted, so badly it was painful, to do something for him, to show that I really hadn’t meant anything by it, that there were no hard feelings.\r\n\r\nThis comic was how I first heard of him. It felt like it was a thing he’d worked on that a lot of people would know. When I learned from Stacey that it had been hacked, and that she couldn’t find her digital copies of the comic pages? Well, if I could find the comic pages, that was something I could do.\r\n\r\nI found the comic pages on the Wayback Machine, but that was during the first day and that didn’t feel like nearly enough. I kept going.\r\n\r\nI’d used a tool called Hugo at work a few months prior, to collect raw data and package it into a slick-looking website, and it seemed to me that a webcomic was a perfect use case for this kind of thing. I knew I was distracting myself, but it wasn’t such a bad distraction, as distractions went. It was inexpensive, harmless and just time-consuming enough to function as the distraction I needed.\r\n\r\nOver the course of a couple months, I got the site knocked together into the form it’s in now, mostly. I learned, or sometimes re-learned, a fair amount of coding in the process. I spent a good couple hours listening to podcasts and endlessly saving pages off the Wayback Machine, diving into their code with repeated regular expressions to pull all the comments out, putting them through filters to format them into a form Hugo could understand easily, organizing them into the closest thing I could make to what the site originally looked like- even where there were things Stacey told me only existed because neither of them was good at websites.\r\n\r\nA year ago, my friend died.\r\n\r\nI still feel guilty, a little. Maybe I always will. At least the site isn’t the Weird Guilty Penance that it started out as. Instead, it’s a tribute to my old friend. It’s the way I met a new friend. It’s one last project I could collaborate with Rades on. Because of it, maybe a few people will get a little extra joy in their lives, courtesy of Rades. It’s one last thing I could do for him. I wish he’d been able to see it.\r\n\r\nI miss him.\r\n\r\n<i>P.S.: It took a lot of wrestling to open up comments on the site. I was torn between hoping people would have nice things to say about him, and wishing they’d leave things exactly as they were. It seems there’s no more choice about it- the tool that powers the comments is sunsetting their free tier, and the only comments ever submitted thus far are spambots, generally in Russian. I’m guessing this will be the last comment on the site. If you do have something you want to add, if you get in touch with me, I can add it. If we get a lot, maybe there can be a tributes page.</i>"
