Stag stacking was BY FAR one of the coolest and funniest random side effects of patch 5.0.4. Tragically, this bug has since been fixed and you can no longer pile druids to the heavens and walk around as a teetering tower of antlers and fur. Such a shame!


Was it supposed to work like that? Well, probably not. But my gosh, was it hilarious. Ah well, R.I.P. stag stacking.


If you never got the chance to see it in action, [here’s a Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec-xh1VsO04).


Less than two weeks before Mists!! Ahhhhhhh so exciting! I hope Vid’s been honing her panda/mantis/dogman/rabbit thing/monkey guy art skills! &gt;:D
