comment: '<p>Kael’s feelings for Jaina are hinted at by a single line from Arthas in WC3: Frozen Throne: “Are you mad I stole Jaina from you, Kael?” (to which Kael’thas does not actually respond).</p><p>His feelings for her are more fleshed-out in the Arthas book, and it makes it very, very clear that Jaina always respected him, even liked him as a person, but was never attracted to him in any way. Kael is basically the textbook of “Nice Guy (TM)” WRT Jaina. It’s pretty pathetic on his behalf.</p>'
