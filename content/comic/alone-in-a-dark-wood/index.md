Hey, nice job Kynrind on predicting the return of Vidâ€™s symbol in the comments last week!  ðŸ˜€


Yesterday was an interesting one in Azeroth â€” Dalaran was completely missing! And even worse, if you had logged out there, when you logged in you fell to your death!

Naturally, I had to do up a little bonus comic commemorating this bizarre moment (based on Kate Beatonâ€™s original comic [here](http://www.harkavagrant.com/?id=259).)
