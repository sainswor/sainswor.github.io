And weâ€™re back! Whatâ€™s Sabellian here for? How is Rades doing? Why did the Broken stop? These answers and more, coming to a From Draenor near you!


We also have some other, exciting news â€“ weâ€™ve started a **Patreon** account! 


Now donâ€™t worry â€“ <u>From Draenor With Love will always remain free for your reading enjoyment.</u> However, working on the comic does take us a lot of time each week, and we do have operating costs such as web hosting, brushes, inks, etc. Weâ€™re coming up on three years of FDWL now, and while we absolutely still love creating for the WoW community, sometimes itâ€™s hard to ignore the bills, or the hours that could otherwise be used on commissions or Blizzcon badges.


For a while, we considered a tip jar, but in the end we felt that Patreon was the better choice. Not only is it a trustworthy, convenient way for readers to help support the comic, but with Patreonâ€™s milestone system, itâ€™s also a great way for us to give something back to our readers and supporters, to show our appreciation!


For the full details, check out our Patreon at **[patreon.com/fromdraenor](http://www.patreon.com/fromdraenor)**! If youâ€™ve enjoyed the comic, please consider taking a look â€“ anything at all will be greatly appreciated. 


And hey, if you canâ€™t spare anything right now or if itâ€™s just not your thing, thatâ€™s totally fine too. We understand. And honestly? The knowledge that youâ€™re here, enjoying our story? Thatâ€™s support enough. ðŸ™‚


Thanks,<br>
Rades &amp; Vid
