In the final fight of Dragon Soul, players have to fight Deathwing while leaping back and forth between a few different islands, carried by Thrall’s winds. 


Unfortunately, Thrall has some…issues…and will occasionally NOT give a player the wind buff, which sends them plummeting to their death in the churning Maelstrom below. This usually results in much anger and frustration, and usually a wipe. 


Is he just trolling us? Or is he just really, really incompetent? Who knows.
