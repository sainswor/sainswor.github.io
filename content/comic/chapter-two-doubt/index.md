Happy New Year, everyone! On to chapter two!


I worried how recognizable Zangarmarsh would be in black &amp; white, without those soft, tranquil shades of blue – but I suppose those giant mushrooms are pretty distinctive. I’ve always loved Zangarmarsh, it’s probably my favorite Burning Crusade zone. Not necessarily for the quests or anything – it’s just so soothing and calming visually.


Will that carry over for comic-Vid and Rades? I guess you’ll have to wait and find out!
