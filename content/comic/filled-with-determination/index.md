Vid sure has a lot to say this week!


And I think most of us would tend to agree with much of what she’s saying. The Horde and Alliance really DO just keep screwing everything up, and both sides are too damn dumb to cooperate and play nice. After all, From Draenor’s entire whole story is about trying to fix one of our bigger blunders, and restoring the Vale. Sure, Garrosh might have been the one who did the deed, but let’s face it, Pandaria was doing pretty good on the whole “control the Sha by controlling your emotions” thing before we washed up on shore.
