comment: '<p>Wrathion has a little problem though. He has to -hit- Sablemane with it first. And it’s not unlikely that Sablemane already knows about the capture orbs. After all he has been in Outland for a very long time and knows a heck of a lot about that world and its inhabitants. I wouldn’t be surprised if he has seen and used Etheral technology before. Or that he is expecting something like this from his genocidal nephew. Sablemane has not survived this long by being stupid or turning his back on threats. And Wrathion is a threat since he has killed all of the Black dragons on Azeroth that he could find.  Somehow I don’t think this is going to end as Wrathion wants.</p>'
