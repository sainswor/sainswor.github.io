While folks were [helping me out to get my legendary](http://manalicious.wordpress.com/2012/05/13/there-are-many-like-it-but-this-one-is-yours/), it occurred to me that I wanted to do something to thank them. You know, apart from just – thanking them. Initially I was going to do little character portraits for everyone, but as the list of people who were involved grew, I started to understand that might be a bit unwieldy.


So instead, Rades and I put our heads together and came up with the idea of a strip featuring all the people. It’s been delayed a few times now, twice by quality concerns (I didn’t want to rush it!) and once by a family emergency. Thanks to our two awesome guest artists who helped out during that time, too (Dee and Aymsorb!). I really appreciate it and you helped me focus on the important stuff.


But I’ve finally managed to get the strip done, and I hope you like it! If you attended any of my Dragonwrath Firelands runs, your character should be in there. Here is a list of people, starting from the back left:


**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Back row:</span>**<br>
Tsunomi (moonkin)<br>
Beruthiel<br>
Maeli<br>
Pix<br>
Cordella<br>
Rooster<br>
Luthvian<br>
Fyriat<br>
(Gnomes in the back):<br>
Aislinana<br>
Priggle<br>
Korixa


**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second row:</span>**<br>
Solard<br>
Tikari<br>
Jasyla<br>
Kurnmogh<br>
Saberine<br>
Cutaia<br>
Killskillz<br>
Khristalla<br>
Lhean


**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Front row:</span>**<br>
Kohbae (cat)<br>
Tahlos<br>
Bittersteel<br>
Shaen<br>
Cursedregis behind<br>
Ghirrl<br>
Nowell<br>
Vosskah<br>
Karanina<br>
Supplicium<br>
Fsob<br>
Tassager (bear front right)


The lone unnamed draenei channeling boss corpses is, of course, Millya (me!) So this is my big thanks to everyone who helped! If you helped and I somehow missed you, I am so sorry. I didn’t keep a good comprehensive list of who attended, and so I had to go back and check signups and try to make sure no one was left out. Even just writing this I remembered one person who was, doh! So please don’t take it personally and know that I am incredibly grateful to you nonetheless.


As far as the comic itself goes – this is another case where art imitates life. I really did have a sinking feeling when I realized I’d be finishing Dragonwrath the *next *week. Transmog is both a blessing and a curse.
