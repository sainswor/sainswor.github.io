*(No, the Sha’s name isn’t Eli. It’s a song reference.)*


Sorry for the font change for the Sha, but I didn’t realize that the previous font would be…well, completely unsuitable for longer passages of text. I think this new look fits it pretty well, anyway!


The Sha are such interesting enemies. We’ve seen that they clearly thrive and draw strength from negative emotions, but at the same time, they’re obviously capable of corrupting creatures and people as well. I really miss those themes from Pandaria, the stories of inner turmoil and inner strength. They were a nice change from the standard “evil is evil / fel is evil / OLD GODS! BURNING LEGION!” storylines that have carried basically every other expansion / major storyline. ESPECIALLY when you start to think about the positive/negative emotion balance compared to the whole Light/Shadow one…
