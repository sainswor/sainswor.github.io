comment: '<p>Hmm, I’m not sure if this… failure of Baine’s memory makes me sad or glad that Magatha *isn’t* on the Siege of Orgrimmar boss list. They could have not messed Garrosh (and, on his coattails, Baine) up so much if they’d written a good story about Magatha scheming to tie into the Siege of Orgrimmar. But if they *had* put her in the raid, would it have been yet another goofed up story? Maybe she’ll get a better chance at having a decent continuation for her storyline by *not* being in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid, the way that story seems to be shaping up.</p>'
