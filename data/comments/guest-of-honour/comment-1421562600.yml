comment: '<p>I think Kairoz and Wrathion were working to create that infinite army, because how else are we gonna survive the entire burning legion focusing on our world? Last time it took out most of the planet. But with an army potentially in the trillions through screwing with timelines like they did for Draenor, not only could they defend azeroth, they would have the numbers to invade back through the Legionâ€™s portals, march the forces of Azeroth across the universe, invading into the twisting nether, something that would require an enormous population Azeroth could not maintain on its own.</p>'
