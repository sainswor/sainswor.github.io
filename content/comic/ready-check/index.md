If you don’t recognize Four’s “pet”, [here’s a hint.](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=67262/bruce)


Confused about the strange hooked shape of Wrathion’s dagger? That’s a type of knife called a [white-quality vendor-purchased](http://www.wowhead.com/item=2207) weapon.


(This isn’t the one Wrathion has, of course. I doubt the Black Prince would be caught dead with an ordinary, *mundane* knife.)
