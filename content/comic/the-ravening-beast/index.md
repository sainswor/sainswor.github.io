So how was everyoneâ€™s *Legion* launch experience? Me, I got myself trapped in the underbelly of an Alliance airship with no way out except for hurling myself out the open hatch to the sea below. Then I abandoned the breadcrumb quest into Stormheim to redo it and take more screenshots, but instead ended up stranded out there with no quests available. Then I hearthed back to Dalaran and broke my Tailoring profession quest by doing *exactly the same thing*. Iâ€™m real good at this game.


Self-caused woes aside, hope everyone is enjoying the new content! ðŸ˜€
