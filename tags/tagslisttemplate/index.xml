This feels fitting in a way, because the comic also ran for five years. If things had been different, maybe Mike and I wouldn‚Äôt even have remembered this milestone. Or we would‚Äôve and said, ‚ÄúHey, isn‚Äôt that neat.‚Äù Neither of us played World of Warcraft anymore, and this project had been largely lost because the original website was hacked and after a few years of not fixing it, I finally let the domain name lapse.</description></item><item><title>Reflections, Part Four</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/reflections-part-four/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2016 09:57:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/reflections-part-four/</guid><description>Five years ago, I thought of a joke that made me laugh. I turned the joke into a single comic featuring my character Vidyala and the character of my friend Rades (aka Mike). I sent it to him to see if he thought it was funny, and whether he might like to do more comics with me. After a lot of brainstorming (especially to come up with the name), From Draenor With Love was born.</description></item><item><title>Reflections, Part Three</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/reflections-part-three/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 10:38:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/reflections-part-three/</guid><description>And now, Four and Wrathion‚Äôs epilogues. We thought about it long and hard, and we really felt Four deserved a happy ending, living happily ever after in Ogri‚Äôla.
Wrathion, on the other hand‚Ä¶well, he‚Äôs got some thinking to do.

You didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd wrap up our story without making Vid draw her favorite orc one last time, did you??
If you don‚Äôt remember what Taran Zhu is referring to, it goes all the way back to the Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar trailer. Remember, the events of FDWL started when Siege of Orgrimmar began. And now, we examine the aftermath ‚Äî of both stories.</description></item><item><title>And We Walked Out Once More Beneath the Stars</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/and-we-walked-out-once-more-beneath-the-stars/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2016 09:57:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/and-we-walked-out-once-more-beneath-the-stars/</guid><description>Almost exactly three years ago, we published the first page of our revamped From Draenor With Love. That was so long ago. That was before Warlords of Draenor was even announced! It‚Äôs kind of surreal to even think about.
And now, 128 pages later, we‚Äôre drawing to a close.
When we set out on this journey, we wanted to explore some themes that we both hold close to our hearts: friendship and family.</description></item><item><title>Under the Mid-Point of That Other Sky</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/under-the-mid-point-of-that-other-sky/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2016 09:55:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/under-the-mid-point-of-that-other-sky/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Whose Shadow a Single Blow Pierced with Light</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/whose-shadow-a-single-blow-pierced-with-light/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2016 09:52:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/whose-shadow-a-single-blow-pierced-with-light/</guid><description>We‚Äôre a week into Legion, and all around me my guildies are talking about Suramar dailies, weird squid world bosses, reputation grinds, and other max-level concerns. Me, I‚Äôm still only level 107, so I‚Äôm just ignoring it all for now! Amusingly, somehow I‚Äôve reached 107 and finished only a single zone, Stormheim. Not via dungeon grinding, either! Just a lot of‚Ä¶meandering about, doing Darkmoon Faire quests, some pet battles, some Archaeology‚Ä¶everything but powerleveling, really.</description></item><item><title>The Ravening Beast</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-ravening-beast/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 09:58:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-ravening-beast/</guid><description>So how was everyone‚Äôs Legion launch experience? Me, I got myself trapped in the underbelly of an Alliance airship with no way out except for hurling myself out the open hatch to the sea below. Then I abandoned the breadcrumb quest into Stormheim to redo it and take more screenshots, but instead ended up stranded out there with no quests available. Then I hearthed back to Dalaran and broke my Tailoring profession quest by doing exactly the same thing.</description></item><item><title>Alone in a Dark Wood</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/alone-in-a-dark-wood/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2016 09:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/alone-in-a-dark-wood/</guid><description>Hey, nice job Kynrind on predicting the return of Vid‚Äôs symbol in the comments last week! üòÄ
Yesterday was an interesting one in Azeroth ‚Äî Dalaran was completely missing! And even worse, if you had logged out there, when you logged in you fell to your death!

And I think most of us would tend to agree with much of what she‚Äôs saying. The Horde and Alliance really DO just keep screwing everything up, and both sides are too damn dumb to cooperate and play nice. After all, From Draenor‚Äôs entire whole story is about trying to fix one of our bigger blunders, and restoring the Vale. Sure, Garrosh might have been the one who did the deed, but let‚Äôs face it, Pandaria was doing pretty good on the whole ‚Äúcontrol the Sha by controlling your emotions‚Äù thing before we washed up on shore.</description></item><item><title>Overconfident</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/overconfident/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 09:55:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/overconfident/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Happy Noblegarden!</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/happy-noblegarden/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 09:53:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/happy-noblegarden/</guid><description>Happy Noblegarden, everyone!

Sorry for the font change for the Sha, but I didn‚Äôt realize that the previous font would be‚Ä¶well, completely unsuitable for longer passages of text. I think this new look fits it pretty well, anyway!

Wrathion seems to think he‚Äôs eliminated the rest of the Black Dragonflight‚Ä¶but we know he‚Äôs missed at least one.
When we were planning out the FDWL storyline, Wrathion meeting Sablemane was one of our major plot points. And I‚Äôve had the above image in my head ever since, of a totally out-of-his-element Wrathion in Blade‚Äôs Edge, gazing up in frozen shock at those iconic stone spires and impaled black dragons overhead.</description></item><item><title>Guest of Honour</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/guest-of-honour/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2015 09:46:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/guest-of-honour/</guid><description>That wraps up Chapter Four!

Speaking of Wrathion, I sure am curious what we‚Äôll see of him in Warlords.

One of the side benefits of being friends with WoW players who a) passionately roleplay draenei; b) hate orcs; c) all of the above, is that when it comes time to write a Broken character who has a huge hate-on for orcs, I have a huge selection of angry dialogue samples ready-made to pull from. üòâ

For those unfamiliar with what Rades is talking about, he‚Äôs referring to the fact that Rexxar, Vol‚Äôjin and Chen are old war buddies. Years ago (in Warcraft III) they fought together, for Thrall‚Äôs Horde, against the then-leader of Theramore, Daelin Proudmoore (Jaina‚Äôs father), who hated the Horde and wanted to respark the Horde-Alliance war. Considering the situation and players involved in the Siege of Orgrimmar, it seems a bit of a similar situation.</description></item><item><title>Let‚Äôs Make a Deal</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/lets-make-a-deal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 02:59:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/lets-make-a-deal/</guid><description>Does anyone actually go back to Gezhe each month and get their monthly Membership Benefits?

One of the most interesting things about writing FDWL is discussing scenes, and realizing how the events in the comic are letting us establish little character traits about Vid &amp;amp; Rades.

If you look at official WoW artwork, there are TONS of different draenei sigils/symbols depicted. Why ARE they different? Do they represent different magical abilities? Or is it like we‚Äôve described here, something biological, like an individual‚Äôs unique DNA footprint?

I worried how recognizable Zangarmarsh would be in black &amp;amp; white, without those soft, tranquil shades of blue ‚Äì but I suppose those giant mushrooms are pretty distinctive.

I also made some changes personally, going back to my roots a bit as it were to ink the comic by hand rather than entirely digitally.</description></item><item><title>Behind the Scenes Part 3: Production</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/behind-the-scenes-part-3-production/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 08:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/behind-the-scenes-part-3-production/</guid><description>For a larger version of today‚Äôs strip, click here.
This is part 3 of 3 of our Behind the Scenes series! Next week we‚Äôll have something‚Ä¶suitable, for the looming 5.4 patch. And then after that it‚Äôll be SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW AND EXCITING! We‚Äôre going to be trying something new so we hope you enjoy it!</description></item><item><title>Behind the Scenes Part 2: Art</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/behind-the-scenes-part-2-art/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 08:03:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/behind-the-scenes-part-2-art/</guid><description>Last week, Rades explained the process of how he scripts and sometimes storyboards a FDWL script! This week I‚Äôm going to be telling you about how I do the sketching and art.

The following is a transcript of text from the above image.
It‚Äôs worth noting that over the time we‚Äôve been doing this I have simplified the art a fair bit to save time.</description></item><item><title>Behind the Scenes Part 1: Script</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/behind-the-scenes-part-1-script/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2013 08:24:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/behind-the-scenes-part-1-script/</guid><description>For a larger version of today‚Äôs strip, click here.

Everyone‚Äôs busy preparing for patch 5.4 and the Siege of Orgrimmar, and we‚Äôre no exception! We‚Äôre working on some significant changes to FDWL that you can expect to see when the patch goes live. For now, we thought we‚Äôd share a bit of the creative process and show just how we do this comic thing!</description></item><item><title>Peons Are People Too</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/peons-are-people-too/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2013 09:12:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/peons-are-people-too/</guid><description>I totally get the Darkspear Rebellion, the disruption of the Kor‚Äôkron war engine, the stealing of valuable resources for the upcoming siege on Orgrimmar. That all makes sense. And if we have to take out a few Kor‚Äôkron Commanders or Goblin Mercenaries while we‚Äôre at it? Sure. No argument here.
But the workers? What did they ever do to us? They‚Äôre just laborers! Red-collar working-class civilians. They‚Äôre just doing their 9 to 5, cutting up meat, chopping down trees, and suddenly we fly in on our giant cosmic dragons, beat ‚Äôem up, blow up their machines, and then take all their stuff.</description></item><item><title>An Unfortunate Turnip of Events</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/an-unfortunate-turnip-of-events/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2013 08:29:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/an-unfortunate-turnip-of-events/</guid><description>Remember the good old days in the first month of Mists, when carrots, lettuce and leeks were flying off the Auction House faster than you could list them, and for outrageous prices? I don‚Äôt even remember exactly, but weren‚Äôt they going for like 100 gold each? 100 GOLD PER TURNIP. And raiders who adamantly insisted they needed the best buff foods possible were crafting those banquets requiring 50 turnips at a time.</description></item><item><title>The Mogu Menace</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-mogu-menace/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2013 08:25:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-mogu-menace/</guid><description>Kill 10 Mogu. Kill 8 more Mogu. Hey guess what? Kill a dozen more.
I wonder just how many Mogu we‚Äôve taken out in our time here? All these Mogu-slaying dailies HAVE to be taking a toll on their population. Hell, I‚Äôve slaughtered a few thousand alone.
Kill Mogu for Valor, kill Mogu for reputation, kill Mogu because they‚Äôre in the way while doing Archaeology‚Ä¶name a reason, and we‚Äôve probably killed a Mogu for it.</description></item><item><title>Insert Emotion Here</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/insert-emotion-here/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2012 09:54:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/insert-emotion-here/</guid><description>When we wrote this joke in our script page three weeks ago, little did we know that the ‚ÄúSha of ____‚Äù joke would become so popular and so prolific before we had a chance to publish. Ah well, live and learn.
There really are unlimited possibilities when it comes to these other, lesser-known Sha. And if they really are manifestation of our emotions, would there not be one for our increasingly weary attitudes about dailies, or the utterly-minor-but-totally-palpable sense of irritation at seeing half a dozen ‚ÄúWiggling‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlluring‚Äù crops that you‚Äôre going to have to deal with?</description></item><item><title>Player Versus Panda</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/player-versus-panda/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2012 10:21:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/player-versus-panda/</guid><description>Have you seen the Mists of Pandaria trailer yet? If not, WHY NOT?
Seriously though. It‚Äôs no wonder they‚Äôre scared. This invincible ninja bear just flew out of the mists, kicking their ass, parrying their combined attacks‚Ä¶
Oh, and also, he‚Äôs level 90.

If you think about it though, the price hike makes total sense! The ethereals aren‚Äôt the sort of people to let this kind of potential profit slip through their bandage-fingers. And besides, with the yak‚Äôs portable reforger making their Orgrimmar/Stormwind services obsolete, they‚Äôd actually be losing money!
Ethereal interference aside, have you SEEN how much stuff is on one of these yaks?</description></item></channel></rss>
