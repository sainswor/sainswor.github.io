Hey folks, my apologies. Due to some personal stuff I wasn’t able to get a comic done this week. Please accept instead this colouring page – it’s a slightly edited version of our page 100 comic that you can print out and colour yourself if you’d like! It was originally available only to [our patrons](https://www.patreon.com/fromdraenor). We’ll be back with the regular comic on schedule next week.

*(A note from Sean: Though the image appears the same size as any other comic, it is much higher resolution. You can view it directly for printing [here](/images/comics/Colouring_Page_100_FDWL.jpg).)*
