Bet you didnâ€™t expect to see Garroshâ€™s ugly mug again, huh? You didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d wrap up our story without making Vid draw her favorite orc one last time, did you??


If you donâ€™t remember what Taran Zhu is referring to, it goes all the way back to the [Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slzQOyS5TqQ) Remember, the events of FDWL started when Siege of Orgrimmar began. And now, we examine the aftermath â€” of both stories.


We hope you enjoy this 4-page epilogue, and how things wrap up!  ðŸ™‚
