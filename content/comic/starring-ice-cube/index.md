Random trivia – this is the first FDWL strip (in the story arc format) that takes place on Azeroth! 


(Which makes sense, I suppose. It’s not called From Azeroth With Love.)


On a similar note, it might seem a little odd that Rades &amp; Vid have spent so much time in Pandaria as compared to Draenor, given our name. But this is about to change!
