comment: '<p>Oh, this is getting good. As powerful as Wrathion is, he is a whelp next to Sabellian. Sabellian has survived many attempts to kill him and should be several orders more powerful than Wrathion ((I never liked the trope of children being more powerful (with mental or physical powers/abilities/skills) than adults, especially those who are trained experts in using that power/ability/skill. The adults would have far more experience than any child or teenager, and experience counts for a LOT more than even natural talent)). Heâ€™s also far more experienced in vicious political maneuverings, so it should be very hard for Wrathion to get the drop on him.</p>'
