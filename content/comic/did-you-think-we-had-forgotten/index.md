*Did you think we had forgotten?*


*Did you think we had forgiven?*


*Yes, that’s right, [Critter Kill Squad](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=5144/critter-kill-squad) achievement. And yes, we definitely remember your gleeful experiments into finding out just how big a creature you could inhale.*


*Oh, there will be a ***RECKONING***, CREEPY CRATE! Your days are numbered! When Mists of Pandaria comes out, your victims will finally be able to fight back. Prepare yourself, Crate, for the terrible vengeance of the CRITTERS!*


*And don’t think you’ve gotten off easy, <a href="https:/www.wowhead.com/spell=71840">Toxic Wasteling!</a>*


***You’re next.***
