Yet another reason why Engineering is the best profession!


Seriously, there’s few things funnier than plopping down Blingtron in a hard-to-reach spot in a well-populated area and sitting back to watch people go MAD as they try to find that elusive free loot. My personal favorites include trees in Halfhill, the upper balconies in Pandalaran, or in the normally-inaccessible catwalk in Orgrimmar’s front auction house.


Thanks to Raijair, Kalbeari, Hachidori, Dhevon and Korrath for the use of your likenesses this week!


(And Millya…padding her appearance numbers, huh Vid? I SEE HOW IT IS.)
