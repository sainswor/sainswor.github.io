comment: '<p>First time I went thru Durumu it was a real pain, raid got wiped several times (me and some other players being 1st-timers with no Vent or TS  didnâ€™t help much T_T )<br>To make it short, we finished him and I got that cool-looking-tentacled-horror of a crossbow I still keep for trans (still looking for the eye-balled shoulders)<br>The best strat for him is moving the screen to look from above (that and an addon to see from a farther distance) helps lots when the purple maze is on.</p>'
