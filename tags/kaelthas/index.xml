It seems like every tier there’s at least one boss with special pets, or a boss that is itself a giant pet. Sometimes they’re just there, leaving their connection to the boss up to your imagination, but some, like Magmaw or Rageface/Riplimb, are outright stated to be pets. And some of them are really loved! Shannox loves his little doggies!</description></item><item><title>The Proudmoore “Problem”</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-proudmoore-problem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2013 09:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-proudmoore-problem/</guid><description>A lot of people think Jaina has this terrible reputation regarding the men in her life, that she has “terrible taste in men”, or that she breaks guys’ hearts and/or makes them go crazy. This is utter nonsense. The problem isn’t with Jaina, the problem is that the men in her life are just plain jerks.
Have you actually LISTENED to the crap these guys say? It’s pretty sad when Garrosh of all people has treated her with more dignity and respect than her so-called close friends.</description></item></channel></rss>
