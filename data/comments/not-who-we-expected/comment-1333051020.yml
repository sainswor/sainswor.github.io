comment: '<p>I think you might be under-playing Garrosh’s part in the evil things the horde has done (I’m not saying the horde is evil, but that they have done some pretty bad stuff. And yes, I’m aware that the alliance aren’t completely innocent in the war themselves). Example, Garrosh killed Cairne dishonorably with his axe that was poisoned “Against his knowledge”. (I don’t know the details on how the next part goes, but this is how I think it went down) The evil Grimtotem are accused, people attack them, and they get banished. And while I do believe they did poison the axe, Somehow Garrosh, the orc who slayed Cairne, is found completely innocent of Cairne’s murder. Also, your example of the druid bombing incident, I looked at the conversation, and I think this sums up the conversation:</p><p>Garrosh conveniently shows up directly after bombing and says, “You Bombed that place!?! How dare you!”</p><p>Unlucky captain, “B-but, leader, didn’t you just ordered me to kil-”</p><p>Garrosh, “I would’ve never said to kill innocents! I’m disgusted by your bloodlust, warmongering, and the disgrace to my honor. I kill you!”</p><p>And captain dies without a trial, and Garrosh is found innocent of whole debacle. And I’m not going into the atrocities that he did in Nelf land (I rudely used up too much text already. My apologies.) Now, Imagine I said Sylvanas every time I said garrosh just now. All I’m saying is that, were it one incident, it can be overlooked, but *A lot* has happened with garrosh, to the point that one can’t quite say he’s not quite evil. I agree that Sylvanas probably is the eviler of the two and should probably be the end expansion boss, but I believe Garrosh is a very close second.</p>'
