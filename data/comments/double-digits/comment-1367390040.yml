comment: '<p>It’s gotten to the point on Horridon where I actually have to stand right next to the first door when the boss is pulled. Cos otherwise, the beginning of the fight always goes like this:</p><p>Moorg (our tank, Tauren Warrior): “Pulling in, five, four, three, two, one.”</p><p>*two, MAYBE three seconds pass*</p><p>Lyon (that’s me! Belf Mage): “I’m dying. …I’m dead.”</p><p>Also, I don’t know if this was on purpose, but I love how excited the Skull decoration is on Horridon, like he just can’t wait for the Pyroblast to finally hit so that he can come kill you.</p>'
