We’re a week into Legion, and all around me my guildies are talking about Suramar dailies, weird squid world bosses, reputation grinds, and other max-level concerns. Me, I’m still only level 107, so I’m just ignoring it all for now! Amusingly, somehow I’ve reached 107 and finished only a single zone, Stormheim. Not via dungeon grinding, either! Just a lot of…meandering about, doing Darkmoon Faire quests, some pet battles, some Archaeology…everything but powerleveling, really. I’m partially through Azsuna, but I strongly suspect I’ll hit max level before finishing it. I’ll still do the other zones, of course – I think I need the reps from them, but I wouldn’t want to miss out on the storylines either!
