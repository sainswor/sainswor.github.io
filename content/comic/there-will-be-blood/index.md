From a recent Mists beta build: [Glyph of Gushing Wound](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/58099-glyph-of-gushing-wound#15851-15882). 


WTF is it with WARRIOR glyphs in Mists? Cripes. Lighting themselves on fire, lightning strikes, flocks of crows, and now MORE BLOOD? Blizz is sure giving them some pretty fun cosmetic options!


Also, these might seriously be my favorite type of strip. I donâ€™t know if Vid was quite as big a fan of this particular one though.

*Vid: haha that one sounds like it could get gross*
