comment: '<p>I surprised a lot of people on my server by paying attention to drops during quests.  I farmed the silly birds in the marsh by the hidden master when the drop rate was 100% and got master of the ways very early.  I am still sad they nerfed that!<br>I never bothered selling, eventually an alt will use it if I keep playing, and if not some guild alt can use it.  Gold is rather easy to get (hint, go farm up your golden fleece in Dread Wastes!)</p>'
