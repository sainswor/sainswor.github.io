comment: '<p>Yeah, I have to say I thought the same thing.</p><p>So let me get this straight, reanimating people against their will (which you complained about happening to you), using biological warfare even Garrosh says is too much, having your forces shoot fleeing civilians, possibly mind controlling those she’s reanimated if the sudden change in atitude of those dalaranians in silverpine and those militia in andorhal is to be rationalized, straight up reprogramming and/or torture of Koltira, using the forsaken as meat shields, using the Horde as tools, possibly knowing about the Plague well before the Wrathgate, attempting to mind-control the Worgen with the scythe of elune, whipping her people into a nigh-genocidal frenzy and overall acting exactly like a lower-power Lich King…</p><p>and yet Garrosh just acts like a warmonger and HE gets labled the bad guy? I get that he look like he’s dabbling in dark magic in Ragefire, but it just seem to me that the demons aren’t that much worse than the undead. I mean… Warlocks, anyone?</p>'
