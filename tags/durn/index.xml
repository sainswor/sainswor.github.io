For example, take the final “bosses” of Nesingwary’s slaughter quests, Bach’lor, Banthar and Gutripper. These formerly-elite beasts always felt like the perfect foes to wrap up the questline – too strong to just take on without some strategy, but definitely soloable if you put some thought and effort into it.</description></item></channel></rss>
