Cataclysm’s general removal of group quests and elite mobs sure has made questing a lot easier, but man, Nagrand just does not feel the same anymore. 


For example, take the final “bosses” of Nesingwary’s slaughter quests, Bach’lor, Banthar and Gutripper. These formerly-elite beasts always felt like the perfect foes to wrap up the questline – too strong to just take on without some strategy, but definitely soloable if you put some thought and effort into it. But nowadays, you don’t even break a sweat taking them out.


And then of course, we’ve got the big guy. Durn? Freaking *[Durn the Hungerer](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=18411)* is soloable now?? You can see this guy from a mile away, and he’s scary-looking as HELL, but you can just walk up and smack him around? It just doesn’t feel right! Granted, it can be pretty hard to find a full 5-man group in Nagrand these days, so perhaps he did need to be tuned down a little. But I think Blizz went too far – poor old Durn is just a shadow of his former self.


Poor little Gronn.
