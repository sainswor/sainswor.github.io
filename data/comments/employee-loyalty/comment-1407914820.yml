comment: '<p>I love the upscaling of distance. Game mechanic wise it doesn’t make sense to have zones that take a day or more to traverse, but in reality the world would need to be massive for all its variety. I really like how you’ve quietly defined just what a huge under-taking all that travel really is.</p><p>Plus it makes for great character development and exposition moments ^_^</p>'
