comment: '<p>If there’s one thing that drives me up the wall more than anything else, it’s the terribly prejudiced and harmful opinion that certain behavior implies homosexuality (or vice versa) – that only gay people are “allowed” to exhibit certain personality traits such as an attention to looking good, being flamboyant and/or effeminate, or in this case, holding a petty grudge over a romantic relationship. </p><p>There is absolutely nothing in this entire conversation or Kael’s dialogue that is a thinly veiled gay insult. Kael is a nobleborn elven prince from a nation of decadence. He’s used to getting what he wants, and he expects this to happen all the time. Rejection or not getting his way is absolutely foreign to him, and his reacting like a spoiled brat is SUPPOSED to be distasteful and invoke negative reactions in us. It’s also absolutely in-character. It’s a royal brat throwing a tantrum, not some egregious insult about his sexuality.</p><p>If you want to say that Golden took liberties with Kael’s character to advance Arthas’ characterization, and you don’t like it, then sure, okay. Or if you want to talk about retcons, have at it. But quit seeing “EWW GAY” insults where there are none, in characters that are simply displaying a broad range of emotional behavior and attitudes that – gasp! – are actually normal personality traits of actual, real-life people, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. </p><p>You can’t “claim” certain behaviors and label them as gay-only any more than you can label things as hetero-only. All people can like sports. All people can like to shop. All people can have poor fashion sense. And all people can hold snarky, petty grudges and make snippy comments about a love interest they felt should have been “theirs.”</p>'
