comment: '<p>Back when I was a printmaking major in college, we had two profs: one wore a white labcoat in the studios and it was always PRISTINE. You’d never know she was around inks or solvents at all. Her polar opposite was another prof who ALWAYS had ink from his hands to his elbows and would splash solvents around with abandon. </p><p>I’m somewhere in the middle – I create a fantastic mess, but I find I work best when I have a bit of space to move and think. Though if you look at the “before” pics I put on Tumblr, it sure wasn’t always as neat. =)</p>'
