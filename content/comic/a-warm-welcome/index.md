While this was definitely the appropriate Sha response, I can’t help but be tickled by the mental image of the Sha obediently following Khadgar’s silly arcane elemental all around Shattrath for like ten minutes, only to fail the quest at the very end because the elemental wandered out of sight or moved around a corner. Man, that quest sucks.
