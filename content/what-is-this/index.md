So here we are. Progress report:

We're live on fromdraenor.ca! That's very exciting. Below is what I'm working on, in the approximate order I'm working on it in.

***New in this update***: Front page has been themed; this page has been added; About (changing some verb tenses); Characters; Contact Us (adding a link to my own Twitter for site issues); Patreon. This page replaces the RSS feed links- I'm going with a philosophy of making the fewest possible changes and making them as unobtrusive as possible.

**Next Up**

Replacing the front page of the site with a copy of And We Walked Once More Beneath The Stars, II. I still need to ask Vid if she wants a copy of her blog post as the "Creator update" for that page, or if she'd prefer to write a brief explanation, or if she'd prefer to have me write one.

**Old Comments:** There's some manual work involved in getting the comments section back up and running. I've got the comments restored for the first half of the comic's run (that is, all of the gag strips) and the first ten pages of the story arc. At the rate I'm doing these, that will probably be finished by the end of the week.

**Pingbacks:** The protocol is inherently insecure- also I can't figure out, frankly, how to trivially get it working on Hugo, which is powering this site. I still have all the archived pingbacks, they're just not being displayed because they are considered comments with an empty status.

**New Comments**: This will be a thing! I have the code working and tested (thanks to Staticman) and just need to make sure the I'm-not-a-robot checkbox works properly. Once that's done, I'll be able to turn comments back on - which is good, because the archived comments are plugged into the comment system, so until new comments can be posted, old ones can't be seen.

**Chapter Links**: Right now three comics claim to be in chapter "Comics" and all the rest are in chapter "CHAPTERTEMPLATE" so, you know, some work to do there.

**The Calendar widget:** Still statically displays August 2018. 

**Chapter Pages:** A gallery-style view of each chapter's contents.

**Tags and Related Comics:** These were only a thing during the gag comic years, but they were there and I'd like to rebuild that function.

**Rewrite this page:** Once the other tasks are finished, this page will be re-written so that instead of a progress report, it's an explanation of why it's fromdraenor.ca, why it was created, and a few brief words on the technology running it for the curious.
