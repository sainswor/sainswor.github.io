comment: '<p>Well, keep in mind the war was only brought to Pandaria because the Horde chased Prince Anduin’s ship there.  And with the exception of the Southern Barrens, I believe the Horde has been on the attack everywhere else in Azeroth (Alliance hasn’t ever been the aggressors, at least).</p><p>I do wonder why the Alliance or even we as the players couldn’t say “Hey, uh, there’s something fishy going on with this artifact in the Vale, maybe we should make sure Garrosh doesn’t get it?”  Blizzard’s railroading – but again, the Alliance didn’t start that.</p>'
