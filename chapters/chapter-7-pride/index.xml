That was so long ago. That was before Warlords of Draenor was even announced! It’s kind of surreal to even think about.
And now, 128 pages later, we’re drawing to a close.
When we set out on this journey, we wanted to explore some themes that we both hold close to our hearts: friendship and family.</description></item><item><title>Under the Mid-Point of That Other Sky</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/under-the-mid-point-of-that-other-sky/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2016 09:55:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/under-the-mid-point-of-that-other-sky/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Whose Shadow a Single Blow Pierced with Light</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/whose-shadow-a-single-blow-pierced-with-light/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2016 09:52:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/whose-shadow-a-single-blow-pierced-with-light/</guid><description>We’re a week into Legion, and all around me my guildies are talking about Suramar dailies, weird squid world bosses, reputation grinds, and other max-level concerns. Me, I’m still only level 107, so I’m just ignoring it all for now! Amusingly, somehow I’ve reached 107 and finished only a single zone, Stormheim. Not via dungeon grinding, either! Just a lot of…meandering about, doing Darkmoon Faire quests, some pet battles, some Archaeology…everything but powerleveling, really.</description></item><item><title>The Ravening Beast</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-ravening-beast/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 09:58:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-ravening-beast/</guid><description>So how was everyone’s Legion launch experience? Me, I got myself trapped in the underbelly of an Alliance airship with no way out except for hurling myself out the open hatch to the sea below. Then I abandoned the breadcrumb quest into Stormheim to redo it and take more screenshots, but instead ended up stranded out there with no quests available. Then I hearthed back to Dalaran and broke my Tailoring profession quest by doing exactly the same thing.</description></item><item><title>Alone in a Dark Wood</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/alone-in-a-dark-wood/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2016 09:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/alone-in-a-dark-wood/</guid><description>Hey, nice job Kynrind on predicting the return of Vid’s symbol in the comments last week! 😀
Yesterday was an interesting one in Azeroth — Dalaran was completely missing! And even worse, if you had logged out there, when you logged in you fell to your death!
Naturally, I had to do up a little bonus comic commemorating this bizarre moment (based on Kate Beaton’s original comic here.)</description></item><item><title>End of the Road, Part Six</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/end-of-the-road-part-six/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2016 09:52:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/end-of-the-road-part-six/</guid><description/></item><item><title>End of the Road, Part Five</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/end-of-the-road-part-five/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 09:55:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/end-of-the-road-part-five/</guid><description>WRATHION NO

Of course, it helps that his voice actor Aaron Phillips does hilarious things like read out fake Guy Fieri menus.</description></item><item><title>All Downhill From Here</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/all-downhill-from-here/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2016 09:58:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/all-downhill-from-here/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Full Circle</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/full-circle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2016 09:52:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/full-circle/</guid><description>Back to Pandaria.

Don’t forget to login soon to reclaim your free Warcraft movie transmogs! Even if you don’t plan on seeing the movie, the transmogs look great and should fit in well to anyone’s collection. 😀</description></item><item><title>The Power of Positive Thinking</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-power-of-positive-thinking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2016 09:58:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-power-of-positive-thinking/</guid><description>Speaking of going back to Pandaria, I too have found myself back in Kun-Lai and Halfhill lately. Since Brawler’s Guild is going away in Legion, I’ve been trying to get all the special quests to unlock the Brawler’s Guild challenge bosses required for Collect Your Deck — partially for the achievement, but also for the shirts you get for beating those bosses. Gotta gear up for the wardrobe!</description></item><item><title>This Is Fine</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/this-is-fine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 09:59:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/this-is-fine/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Stalwart Heart</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-stalwart-heart/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 09:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-stalwart-heart/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Something Wicked This Way Comes</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/something-wicked-this-way-comes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 09:51:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/something-wicked-this-way-comes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Filled With Determination</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/filled-with-determination/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 09:55:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/filled-with-determination/</guid><description>Vid sure has a lot to say this week!
And I think most of us would tend to agree with much of what she’s saying. The Horde and Alliance really DO just keep screwing everything up, and both sides are too damn dumb to cooperate and play nice. After all, From Draenor’s entire whole story is about trying to fix one of our bigger blunders, and restoring the Vale. Sure, Garrosh might have been the one who did the deed, but let’s face it, Pandaria was doing pretty good on the whole “control the Sha by controlling your emotions” thing before we washed up on shore.</description></item><item><title>Overconfident</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/overconfident/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 09:55:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/overconfident/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Together</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/together/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2016 10:22:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/together/</guid><description>COOL AS A CUCUMBER</description></item><item><title>That Cold Black Cloud</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/that-cold-black-cloud/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2016 09:51:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/that-cold-black-cloud/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Warm Welcome</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/a-warm-welcome/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2016 09:52:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/a-warm-welcome/</guid><description>While this was definitely the appropriate Sha response, I can’t help but be tickled by the mental image of the Sha obediently following Khadgar’s silly arcane elemental all around Shattrath for like ten minutes, only to fail the quest at the very end because the elemental wandered out of sight or moved around a corner. Man, that quest sucks.</description></item><item><title>Destiny, Part 2</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/destiny-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2016 09:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/destiny-part-2/</guid><description>Well, maybe some things were simply meant to be.</description></item><item><title>Destiny, Part 1</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/destiny-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 09:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/destiny-part-1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ding!</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/ding/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2016 09:43:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/ding/</guid><description>Level (page?) 100!

It’s a song reference.)
Sorry for the font change for the Sha, but I didn’t realize that the previous font would be…well, completely unsuitable for longer passages of text. I think this new look fits it pretty well, anyway!
The Sha are such interesting enemies. We’ve seen that they clearly thrive and draw strength from negative emotions, but at the same time, they’re obviously capable of corrupting creatures and people as well.</description></item><item><title>Outmatched</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/outmatched/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2016 10:16:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/outmatched/</guid><description>Being almost a full expansion past Mists of Pandaria, it’s easy to forget just how freaking creepy the Sha are! And their weird shadowy, void-like essence always did strike me as one of the more sinister forms of attack. Do they burn? Do they burn your spirit? Who knows!</description></item><item><title>Chapter Seven: Pride</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/chapter-seven-pride/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2016 09:47:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/chapter-seven-pride/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
