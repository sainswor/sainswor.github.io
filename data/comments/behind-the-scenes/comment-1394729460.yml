comment: '<p>Hah! DO keep in mind that the magnetic paint is SUPER thick and blackâ€¦ it left some ridges on my walls and a visible line where the paint ended (I used masking tape to mark off the magnetic area). I have heard that thereâ€™s also a powder you can mix into any colour of paint to make it magnetic but donâ€™t have personal experience with that. I do know it took me two coats of primer and three coats of white paint to cover the magnetic paint. Such a pain! I hope your room design works out. ðŸ™‚</p>'
