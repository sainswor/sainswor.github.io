comment: '<p>Funny aside, I think it’s important to note that the Mogu don’t seem to really die when we kill them.  Their spirits, or whatever, can pick up other stone bodies and the like when we kill them.  So I see this chamber somewhere that we haven’t found yet where the ghosts of Mogu come and jump into another stone statue and BAM, they’re back on the ground. I think we’ve been killing the same ones for weeks now!</p>'
