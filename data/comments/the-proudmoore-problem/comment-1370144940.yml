comment: '<p>His comment in the book can definitely be interpreted many ways. I’ve heard people react with anger because Thrall’s supposed “solution” was A MAN, but I’ve also heard people say that no, it’s fine, because it wasn’t specifically a man so much as it was a spouse. Either way, there is of course the other idea that some people don’t necessarily WANT a spouse as a way to make themselves happy, or that marriage is a magical solution, but that’s getting into a completely different issue!</p><p>Personally? I feel that people are certainly justified in feeling a little annoyed at Thrall’s comments, but at the same time, I think this is a good thing. Even if his advice isn’t perfect or isn’t necessarily the most PR, that’s okay – because it’s Thrall speaking, not Blizzard. THRALL is not perfect, and at his core, he’s a pretty simple person. If his good friend is feeling down, he probably would just tell her – with nothing but good intentions – that what has made him truly happy is marriage. Now Jaina (and us) might roll her eyes, might give him a “seriously, that’s your big ‘advice’ for me?” etc, but hey, that’s earnest, honest Thrall for you.</p><p>Anyway, it’s a very mixed message, but you’re absolutely right, it’s been exaggerated a tad in the strip.  😉  By itself, it wouldn’t have been strong enough to carry the joke, but it fit nicely when added to the other guys’ comments.</p>'
