comment: '<p>I feel like there may have been a misunderstanding here.</p><p>(Er, Hali, if youâ€™re still around, please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong.  And Iâ€™m sorry if I end up making things worse by jumping into the middle of this.  My need to Share All the Info with people can make me a real busybody sometimes.)</p><p>Some Kael fans view him as bisexual rather than straight (or gay), and have been doing so since long before RotLK came out.  Rather than interpreting his â€œimmature behaviorï¿½? as a sign of queerness, I think it was a matter of seeing the character as queer (based on certain aspects of his relationship with Illidan) in WC3, and then reading his subsequent descent into villainy as homophobia-based derailment.  They also choose not to count the Arthas novel as canon because they see it as retroactive vilification to justify Kael becoming a raid boss.</p><p>To be clear, Iâ€™m not saying that I agree with this.  If you remember my old blog comments, Lani, Iâ€™ve made it pretty clear that my views are much closer to yours.  Iâ€™m more of a Silvermoon trio fan than a Kael fan, and I generally like Christie Goldenâ€™s work, though I could have done without the Nice Guy Kael portrayal.  But I do think you guys were off base in assuming Halimede was straight and implying they were homophobic, though I can why you interpreted the comment that way.  I just have the extra context ofâ€¦well, stalking everyone in the fandom until their views are familiar to me.  ðŸ˜‰</p>'
