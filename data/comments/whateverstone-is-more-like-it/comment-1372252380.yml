comment: '<p>And this is why I have been avidly reading <a href="http://commandboard.wordpress.com/" onclick="_gaq.push([&#39;_trackEvent&#39;, &#39;outbound-comment&#39;, &#39;http://commandboard.wordpress.com/&#39;, &#39;http://commandboard.wordpress.com/&#39;]);" rel="nofollow">http://commandboard.wordpress.com/</a> – the Warchief’s Command Board is Garrosh’s blog. He’s got a cast of supporting characters (some actually in WoW, some not), plays Earth Online, writes poetry, and generally is a believable, realistic character.</p><p>I do recommend starting at the beginning, because recent posts are so dependent on what has happened that you have to go a long way back to figure out what’s going on anyway. It’s a long read, but extremely funny much of the time, and doesn’t abuse lore nearly as much as Blizzard does.</p><p>Love the expressions, and the camera angle in the first panel is great. The doomstone is adorable, and I have always wondered what happens to Magatha after Thousand Needles…</p>'
