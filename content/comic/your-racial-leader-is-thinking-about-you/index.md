It occurred to Vid and I yesterday that perhaps we should have saved the comic with the NAKED ORC for our Valentine’s Day update. Apparently we are unable to read calendars. 


We figured we needed to do SOMETHING love-themed for this week – after all, the comic IS From Draenor With ***LOVE***!


Well, who better to feature on our special Valentine’s Day card than another local from Draenor, the Warchief himself! I mean, Garrosh *does* thank you and give you a card each day when you give him a Lovely Charm Bracelet. (Or should I say, he “thanks” you.)


Oh, that Garrosh. What a sweetie.
