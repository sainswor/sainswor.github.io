comment: '<p>Iâ€™d need to actually read the conversationâ€¦ but what you just said (Rades) is a hell of a lot less sexist than how it comes off in the comic just now (the comic that i love &lt;3).  Put the most recent way, it comes off as "Love is awesome! Try it!" â€¦ which is tacky but not as bad as "women need men (but not vice versa)."  â€¦ but it could also imply that she isn''t complete without loveâ€¦ but that would imply *he* wasn''t complete without loveâ€¦  point is, being told to make babies and do nothing else is insulting (which is what is implied with the "you need a husband" remark), especially to a MAGE and a LEADER.  "Find Somebody To Love" is less so.  Howeverâ€¦ other people who voraciously defend their single-hood might view that comment in the same light as I view "you need a husband"!  I''m a believer in love, and that everyone needs love and people to loveâ€“ romantically, not-romanticallyâ€¦ at allâ€¦<br>â€” Note Bene: I love your comics and art style ðŸ˜€  I''ve been reading since the lost ring comic(s).<br>â€“Male Vanity is so a thing, it''s awesomeâ€¦ I''m a student of history and it isâ€¦ really cool to see how men express themselves through fashion.  BEs being all vain just makes me think of places like 18th century France, or metrosexuals.  After all, every girl''s crazy about a sharp-dressed man!</p>'
