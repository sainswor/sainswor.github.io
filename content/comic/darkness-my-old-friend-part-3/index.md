One of the side benefits of being friends with WoW players who a) passionately roleplay draenei; b) hate orcs; c) all of the above, is that when it comes time to write a Broken character who has a huge hate-on for orcs, I have a huge selection of angry dialogue samples ready-made to pull from.  ðŸ˜‰


(As for said Broken, he is of course referring back to the events of <a href="/comic/random-encounter/">Page #18</a>.)


Next week we wrap up Chapter 3!
