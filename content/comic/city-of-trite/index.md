I’d like to tell you that eventually mangling draenic phrases gets old, but I’d be lying. It’s one of my favorite things to do. 


But it’s not just me! After reading the script, Vid told me she’s always liked the one that sounds like “buy your niece a car.”


I can’t wait until Warlords of Draenor where we’ll get even *more* expressions to abuse!
