Is there anything more pitiful and/or annoying than running through a low level zone and accumulating a swarm of low-level grey mobs? It’s like, dudes, I’m just here to get some Goldthorn to level Alchemy, go away. 


And then they DAZE YOU and DISMOUNT YOU and suddenly you’re knee-deep in a sea of blood and linen cloth.
