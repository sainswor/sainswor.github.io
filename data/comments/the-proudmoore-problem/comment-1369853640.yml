comment: '<p>Ah, so, we’re running on the assumption that Golden’s homophobic, gross portrayal of Kael was ALWAYS CANON? Dude, get out, I thought better of you. People glom onto his other-insults line on WC3 and use that to justify what’s basically “oh, oh, let’s treat the man whose race is joked about as being gaaaay like he’s a nasty harpy, that’s not gross and gender essentialist and homophobic at all, tee hee!” Spare me, y’all 😉 When I was playing thru that campaign back long before that tripey novel was a twinkle in Golden’s eye, it read to me clearly like Arthas was a little twerp about having “won” Jaina, and while it’s obnoxious for Kael to hold a grudge, he IS very angry at Arthas for good reason. Basically, Golden vilified Kael to make Arthas look better, and she isn’t a good writer.</p><p>Retcons are retcons. Don’t pretend they were always a part of the plot proper, kay? 😉 Until Knaak got ahold of Illidan he wasn’t ~just always a crazy jerk lulz lulz~, either, and do not get me started on how he handles Maiev!</p><p>tl;dr yeah, retcons are retcons, but it irritates me to see otherwise-clever people jumping on the Kael-is-a-bitch-lol bandwagon. I see enough stupid EWW GAY bollocks in-game and I don’t need to be seeing it out of game! 😉</p>'
