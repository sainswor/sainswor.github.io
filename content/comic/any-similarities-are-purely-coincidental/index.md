I just want everyone to know that I combed the Auction House for weeks looking for [Ethereum Prison Keys](http://www.wowhead.com/item=29460/ethereum-prison-key), for reference &amp; accuracy. ***And they didnâ€™t help at all.*** 


So we came up with something new for the prison spheres, something that would make sense with their role in ethereal society, and with where we encounter them in Bladeâ€™s Edge and Netherstorm. And of course, something that may seem a little familiar.  ðŸ˜‰


This marks the end of <a href="/chapter/chapter-2-doubt">Chapter Two!</a> Vidâ€™s on vacation right about now, so weâ€™ll be taking a week or two off, but weâ€™ll be back soon. Thanks for reading and commenting so far, see you in Chapter Three!
