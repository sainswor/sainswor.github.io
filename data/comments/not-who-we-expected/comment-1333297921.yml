comment: '<p>Gotta disagree with you about Cairne’s death. Garrosh had absolutely nothing to do with the dishonorable nature of that incident, it was entirely Magatha behind it. Garrosh can’t even be blamed for the duel, because Cairne was the one who challenged him, not the other way around. Garrosh is actually just as mad at Magatha for poisoning the axe, because he was cheated out of an honorable duel, and he would have rather died honorable to a worthy foe than win dishonorably. (He says this, this isn’t guesswork.)</p>'
