Look at us! Blizzcon week and not even missing a beat? YEAH! But seriously, Vid worked like a maniac to get a few strips done ahead of time, so she definitely earned the vacation time! It certainly wouldn’t have been the end of the world to have a filler strip or two, but we’re pretty pleased that we didn’t have to resort to that!


As for Blizzcon itself – WOW! Exciting stuff! And…Warlords of *Draenor??* That’s remarkably funny, considering FDWL’s plotline, isn’t it? I feel I can safely reveal to you that no, you won’t be seeing time-traveling Garrosh show up in the comic any time soon (even though Vid just LOVES drawing Garrosh), but that’s all I’ll say for now!  &gt;:D
