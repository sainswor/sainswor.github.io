Oh, [Murglesnout](http://www.wowhead.com/item=53069). Fisher’s bane. So plentiful. So abundant. 


So utterly, completely worthless.


True, Blizzard did eventually add in a [Cooking recipe](http://www.wowhead.com/item=68687) so that the dreaded Murglesnout wasn’t COMPLETELY pointless. But it’s TOO LATE! Even now, the mere sight of THIS TERRIBLE FISH fills me with rage. MURGLESNOUT!


…however, it really does make a fun “gift” to give friends. 


If you want to MAKE THEM ANGRY!


MURGLESNOUT!
