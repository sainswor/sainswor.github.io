Patch 5.0.4 is here and there’s so many exciting things to check out! Account-wide mounts! New talent systems! AoE looting! Revamped Scarlet Monastery, Scholomance and Ragefire Chasm! And there’s even apparently a new ferocious Darkmoon Rabbit world boss owning fools out at the Darkmoon Faire? I haven’t seen this fellow myself yet, but I’ve heard the hilarious horror stories.


The world (of Warcraft) is suddenly a very new and thrilling place to be, and I love it.


I think my favorite part about this strip is how Vid personally headed to the Deeprun Tram to accurately draw the third panel, and actually polymorphed all the rats for authenticity. I asked her, “No penguins?” to which she replied “I don’t have that one!” Now that’s artistic dedication.


Seriously though, if you’re a mage and you’re not out there sheeping/turtling/monkeying/kittying every single critter you come across, you should be ashamed of yourself. There’s a lot of maggots and cockroaches skittering about out there, waiting for your magic touch! GET SHEEPING!


Now if you need me, I’ll be over here, Holy Shocking players to death on my Holy Paladin and cackling uncontrollably.
