Hey, it’s back to familiar territory! Personally, Zangarmarsh is my favorite zone in Outlands. The colours and environment is just so peaceful and soothing.


Writing dialogue for Four can be tough, and I admit I struggled a bit with this page. She’s guarded, with a peculiar manner of speaking. This was a LOT for her to say. But I think it turned out well, and maybe explains a bit about her and just how she ended up with a Black Dragon for an employer.
