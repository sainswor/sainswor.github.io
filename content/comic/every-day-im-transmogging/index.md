This may be my favourite FDWL in the history of ever. (I know, we’ve only done less than 20 strips but even so!)


Usually the way we make strips is one of us has an idea and pitches it to the other, then we start to brain-storm and perhaps refine or change a few things. Sometimes the strip is fully formed, as when Rades presented this one to me like so:


“So I have an idea for a strip, it’s a lot of art, but you’ll get to draw Millya…”


“SOLD.”


(Millya being my mage and main character, she isn’t the main FDWL character for a variety of reasons, but that doesn’t mean I wasn’t excited to draw her.)


On top of that, I had the chance to draw the variety of outfits I so enjoy. One of my guildies joked that I must just logout in the transmog room, and he’s almost right. I have to change outfits at least once a week (it’s so gauche to show up to a raid wearing the same outfit two times in a row!)


So, I pretty much AM playing World of Dresscraft, and I don’t mind one bit.


Fun fact, every robe/dress in this strip actually exists. Even the piled clothes at the end are generally based on an actual robe, see if you can name ’em all! You don’t really win a prize, except maybe the Master Clothier title.
