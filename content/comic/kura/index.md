I think one of our favorite things is designing new characters. Sure, it takes us forever because we usually have vastly different ideas about attire and equipment, and then naming them takes even longer as we toss ideas back and forth and examine existing naming conventions. But EVENTUALLY they get completed and then we can love them.  ðŸ˜€
