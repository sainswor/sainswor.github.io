comment: '<p>Hm. According to WoWpedia, Nyxondra was forced by Rhea to lay eggs, which… Wouldn’t that mean that Wrathion effectively does not have a father?<br>I guess Blizzard derped a tiny bit (okay, more than a tiny bit) on the lore and its implications here. And probably best not delved into too deep, otherwise we might get quite… interesting results. That would, again, in turn provide some extra silly things.</p>'
