comment: '<p>Hmm, i dunno about that. That smacks to me of retconning, and I really take issue with Goldenâ€™s portrayal of Kael (it is homophobic as hellâ€“he acts like a stereotypical jilted woman, ugh, misogyny for the loss).  I always parsed the â€˜insultâ€™ as Arthas being a little goober about the fact that Jaina liked him more. But I suppose youâ€™re free to act as if the novelsâ€™ retroactive continuity was ~always~ a part of canon even though it absolutely wasnâ€™t. ðŸ˜‰</p>'
