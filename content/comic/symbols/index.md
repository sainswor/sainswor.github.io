Aw yiss, inventing us some headcanon draenei lore! Observant readers may remember that we alluded to these personal symbols <a href="/comic/bonus-character-profile-vidyala/">back in Vid’s character profile</a>.


If you look at official WoW artwork, there are TONS of different draenei sigils/symbols depicted. Why ARE they different? Do they represent different magical abilities? Or is it like we’ve described here, something biological, like an individual’s unique DNA footprint?


Personally, I think it’s a lot cooler to imagine those symbols as displays of personal identity rather than just to indicate “I’m using magic.”
