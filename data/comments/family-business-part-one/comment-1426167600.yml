comment: '<p>Oh dont get me started on the whole novel thing. Never even heard of the novels before i was almost done with Cata and to find out that it was a novel rather then a ingame storyline really annoyed me. And did they advertise them somehow? Like i said i never even heard of them aside from one or two that were more lore from the age of the RTS games. : /</p>'
