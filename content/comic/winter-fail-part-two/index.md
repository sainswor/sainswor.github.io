The saga continues! Oh no, poor Greatfather Winter! 


Vid did an awesome job with the expressions in this strip, I think you’ll all agree. I’m now using the “Sad Rades” face as my avatar, and I can’t even look at panel 3 without laughing.


There was some debate about which Greatfather Winter to use – the dwarven Alliance version, or the orcish Horde version! In the end though, we decided to go with the dwarf, to include more races. From Draenor With Love, racial diversity since 2011, yo.


Check in next week to see how Rades and Vid approach their new “duties” !
