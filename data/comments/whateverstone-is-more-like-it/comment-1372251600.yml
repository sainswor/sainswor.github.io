comment: '<p>I feel like resolving Magatha’s story once Garrosh is gone and out of the picture is such a waste. Garrosh and Baine are her primary story hooks right now, since she must be harboring such a huge grudge against them. Things like ruining Garrosh’s reputation and causing his downfall, sneakily from behind the scenes or subtle manipulation…this is right up her alley. I was hoping Malkorok would be her agent, allowing her to pull the strings, and while it’s still POSSIBLE I suppose…I don’t think it’s very likely.</p><p>I guess there’s still Baine afterward, but there’s not that same hatred there. I don’t think she LIKES Baine, but compared to Garrosh, it’s not even close. Baine was taking back his city and avenging his murdered kin, but Garrosh did much worse – he humiliated her.</p>'
