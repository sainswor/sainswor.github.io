comment: '<p>First, I want to make it clear that I have *not* read the novels, so what I’m about to say could still be wrong. That being said, I think there’s a legitimate explanation here that Blizz could use: sha corruption (bear with me on this!). I’m not certain what the Horde intro quest to Pandaria is, but for Alliance, the first quest chain ends with a Night Elf SI:7 agent (I might be mistaken about him being in SI:7) being twisted by the sha. He was trying to stop the Alliance forces from attacking unarmed Horde-members who were swimming to shore, the other Alliance commander says to attack anyway, and the N-elf suddenly agrees, just as he is visually overtaken by sha corruption.</p><p>This has happened all over Pandaria, and it’s basically the entire plot point behind: the Shado-Pan Monastery and Jade Temple dungeons, the Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Springs raids, and countless quest-lines scattered throughout just about every zone. To be fair, this wouldn’t entirely explain events like the bombing of Theramore, but it’s a workable, reasonable explanation for all the shenanigans Garrosh has been engaged in.</p><p>Again, I’ve been actively avoiding spoilers (shocking, I know haha), so I have no idea what explanation Blizz is using. If Blizz doesn’t explain what’s been going on with Garrosh, then I’m with you on your rant, Rades!</p>'
