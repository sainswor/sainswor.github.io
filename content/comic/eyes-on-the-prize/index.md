Okay, this isn’t exactly how [Flare](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1543/flare) works in-game, but Rades *IS* an engineer, after all.


This week’s [patch notes](https://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/16549669/603-patch-notes-10-27-2014) were pretty funny, especially “Thrall received a reminder that he is currently still on Azeroth.” Of course, instead of talking like he was already on Draenor, Thrall now talks like he’s back in Orgrimmar as Horde Warchief. Oh, Thrall.


Vid got a [Grand Expedition Yak](https://www.wowhead.com/item=84101/reins-of-the-grand-expedition-yak) this week, which means Transmog ANYWHERE, ANYTIME. Or as she put it, “I AM ON MY FARM TRANSMOGGING IT IS AMAZING”
