A Glyph that *[causes a lightning strike?](http://mop.wowhead.com/spell=68164)*


…I have a sudden urge to play a warrior in Mists.


Seriously though, it’s terrific that Blizzard is giving us all these new fun cosmetic glyphs. They’re little touches, but damn are they cool.


My personal favorite so far? That would be [Glyph of the Geist](http://mop.wowhead.com/item=43535). BECAUSE GEISTS ARE AWESOME.


(In other news, I think Vid is going to revolt if I make her draw Garrosh again.)
