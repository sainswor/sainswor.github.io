And that‚Äôs it for Chapter 3! &amp;gt;:D Things are getting real.
Today‚Äôs page also marks a special occasion for FDWL ‚Äì it‚Äôs officially been one year since we started the story! We know this because it‚Äôs ALSO Siege of Orgrimmar‚Äôs one-year anniversary (which is‚Ä¶special‚Ä¶in its own way) and we specifically launched Chapter 1: Despair to coincide with the patch‚Äôs events.
It‚Äôs been an exciting year for FDWL, and I think we‚Äôve definitely both learned a lot about the comic process, as well as simply what it takes to make a weekly webcomic work without killing each other.</description></item><item><title>Darkness, My Old Friend, Part 3</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/darkness-my-old-friend-part-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 09:51:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/darkness-my-old-friend-part-3/</guid><description>document.createElement('audio'); /media/042_angryriver.mp3
One of the side benefits of being friends with WoW players who a) passionately roleplay draenei; b) hate orcs; c) all of the above, is that when it comes time to write a Broken character who has a huge hate-on for orcs, I have a huge selection of angry dialogue samples ready-made to pull from. üòâ
(As for said Broken, he is of course referring back to the events of Page #18.</description></item><item><title>Darkness, My Old Friend, Part 2</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/darkness-my-old-friend-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2014 09:43:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/darkness-my-old-friend-part-2/</guid><description>This week‚Äôs soundtrack:
(I don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôll post a song for every page, but I figure if we have one that fits, we might as well!)
Ah, the Broken. You can‚Äôt really delve into draenei and orc lore without visiting them. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Broken lore, you should absolutely go read Micky Neilson‚Äôs short story Unbroken. It‚Äôs a fantastic read. Just be warned that our Broken, are not necessarily like Nobundo‚Ä¶</description></item><item><title>Darkness, My Old Friend, Part 1</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/darkness-my-old-friend-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2014 09:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/darkness-my-old-friend-part-1/</guid><description>WELP

Personally, Zangarmarsh is my favorite zone in Outlands. The colours and environment is just so peaceful and soothing.
Writing dialogue for Four can be tough, and I admit I struggled a bit with this page. She‚Äôs guarded, with a peculiar manner of speaking. This was a LOT for her to say. But I think it turned out well, and maybe explains a bit about her and just how she ended up with a Black Dragon for an employer.</description></item><item><title>Definitely Skull Level, Part 2</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/definitely-skull-level-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2014 09:53:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/definitely-skull-level-part-2/</guid><description>Would-be rogues know what Rades is talking about.

(Which makes sense, I suppose. It‚Äôs not called From Azeroth With Love.)
On a similar note, it might seem a little odd that Rades &amp;amp; Vid have spent so much time in Pandaria as compared to Draenor, given our name. But this is about to change!</description></item><item><title>Ready Check</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/ready-check/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2014 09:47:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/ready-check/</guid><description>If you don‚Äôt recognize Four‚Äôs ‚Äúpet‚Äù, here‚Äôs a hint.
Confused about the strange hooked shape of Wrathion‚Äôs dagger? That‚Äôs a type of knife called a white-quality vendor-purchased weapon.
(This isn‚Äôt the one Wrathion has, of course. I doubt the Black Prince would be caught dead with an ordinary, mundane knife.)</description></item><item><title>When I asked if you had BG experience, I wasn‚Äôt talking about PVP</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/when-i-asked-if-you-had-bg-experience-i-wasnt-talking-about-pvp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 09:46:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/when-i-asked-if-you-had-bg-experience-i-wasnt-talking-about-pvp/</guid><description>Confession: We realize the Tushui Alliance lion isn‚Äôt technically the symbol of the Brawler‚Äôs Guild, but the Brawler‚Äôs guild doesn‚Äôt actually HAVE a symbol! We checked the arena, the shirts, the NPCs, nothing.
But you know what? Both Horde and Alliance began running their Brawler‚Äôs Guild at around the same time as the two Pandaren factions joined up, so maybe Aysa and Ji brought the tradition with them.
(Shhhh, just go with it.</description></item><item><title>Four‚Äôs Company</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/fours-company/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 04:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/fours-company/</guid><description>Way, way back when we were planning out the FDWL plot, we knew that one of Wrathion‚Äôs bodyguards would become part of the story. Originally, I had penciled in Right, who ‚Äì along with her partner, Left ‚Äì can always be seen wherever their boss goes. I thought it would be fun to explore this cool, badass-looking woman, who despite numerous appearances in-game, never actually speaks or does anything.
But after talking it over with Vid, we realized that while it would be interesting to use Right, we had a great opportunity to create a brand new person instead!</description></item><item><title>Three‚Äôs Company</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/threes-company/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2014 04:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/threes-company/</guid><description>Hmm, who could that be up there in the balcony, listening in?

Just a reminder that even though War Crimes just came out, and Garrosh‚Äôs trial is what‚Äôs ‚Äúcurrently‚Äù happening, FDWL takes place during the Siege of Orgrimmar timeframe.
As for whether this is directly relevant? Well, let‚Äôs just say we‚Äôve both got the book and are pretty curious to see what all happens. üòâ</description></item></channel></rss>
