More like “Hour of Waiting For Thrall To Run The Entire Stupid Way in Ghost Wolf Form”, right?


Anyway, we never DO find out what happens to Thrall’s horse in Escape from Durnholde. Everyone else in Old Hillsbrad seemed destined for big things – Kel’Thuzad, Herod, Thrall himself, Old Blanchy – so wouldn’t it be funny if the horse also had some great destiny?


And when you think “when in history would a SURPRISE HORSE be absolutely perfect?”, could there be any more deserving situation than Hour of Twilight? You were the freaking Warchief, don’t you have a wolf or something??
