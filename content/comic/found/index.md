Annnnd we’re back! It’s been a great month off for us to get our batteries recharged, and we can’t wait to finish this story! It’s been a long undertaking, perhaps longer than either Vid or I initially realized, but we’re confident that in the end it’ll be one we can look back on proudly.


Now that Warlords’ story has mostly been told, we can breathe a slight sigh of relief, as there was always the slight worry that some of the lore events might overlap or clash with what we had in mind with FDWL. Draenor, the Broken, Wrathion…it was unlikely, but possible. But it should be clear sailing from there.


Finally, thank you to our latest Patreon supporter, Debra! We may have been on hiatus last month, but we didn’t forget about you!
