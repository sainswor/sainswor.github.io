When we wrote this joke in our script page *three weeks ago*, little did we know that the “Sha of ____” joke would become so popular and so prolific before we had a chance to publish. Ah well, live and learn.


There really are unlimited possibilities when it comes to these other, lesser-known Sha. And if they really are manifestation of our emotions, would there not be one for our increasingly weary attitudes about dailies, or the utterly-minor-but-totally-palpable sense of irritation at seeing half a dozen “Wiggling” and “Alluring” crops that you’re going to have to deal with?  /shudder


Why can’t there just be a Sha of Buttercups? Or a Sha of Candy? I think they’d be very popular across Pandaria.
