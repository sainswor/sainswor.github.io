Kill 10 Mogu. Kill 8 more Mogu. Hey guess what? Kill a dozen more.


I wonder just how many Mogu we’ve taken out in our time here? All these Mogu-slaying dailies HAVE to be taking a toll on their population. Hell, I’ve slaughtered a few thousand alone. 


Kill Mogu for Valor, kill Mogu for reputation, kill Mogu because they’re in the way while doing Archaeology…name a reason, and we’ve probably killed a Mogu for it.


Even Taran Zhu would probably have to admit that it’s all a little staggering, when you stop and think about it.
