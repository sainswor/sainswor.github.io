I wonder if we’ll see any Broken this expansion. I know history has changed, and the orcs didn’t drink the blood of Mannoroth…but Gul’dan IS out there, green-skinned and demon-tainted. So there’s definitely fel magic on the table, albeit on a smaller scale – for now, at least. And judging from the questlines, you KNOW Gul’dan has some pretty significant plans of his own meant to further his own schemes, and probably those of the Legion, who clearly still have their eyes on Draenor…
