comment: '<p>In the beta, I found the talk with Varian as an incoming Pandaren interesting, and I imagine it is the same with the Horde, where friendships across enemy lines are not tolerated (although I am quite sure this is just a gameplay mechanic to segregate Alliance from Horde).</p><p>But how do the lines of friendship intersect with those of duty/conscience? I can understand attacking military targets and strategems, but when those you call friend support a faction that seeks to make war on you or your way of life, and when they engage in tactics that most would call reprehensible, how do friends proceed?</p><p>Thrall kept insisting Garrosh was the man (well, orc) for the job as Warchief, and now his friend Jaina has lost most everything she held dear because of Garrosh’s decisions. I can’t help but imagine there will be consequences to be faced on a personal level for Thrall.</p>'
