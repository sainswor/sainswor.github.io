Do you need a little something to set you apart from the crowd at Blizzcon? Would you like a small piece of art to call your own and remember all the good times you had at the convention? I’ve been painting up just the thing!


These little paintings are painted on thick, high-quality Arches watercolour paper with Winsor &amp; Newton watercolours. In a world of art that’s increasingly digital, I find I am loving going back to my roots and painting with brushes and pigments again.


The character paintings are 2 7/8″ x 3 7/8″, just shy of 3″ x 4″ so that they fit easily into the heavy duty badge holder. The background matches your class colour. The name tags featured accompany your card to proudly display your character name inside of the badge holder, but when Blizzcon is over – it’s separate, and you can remove it and just have the painting in its entirety.


I am charging $40 USD for these, which includes:


-one painting of your character, shipped to you anywhere in North America (shipping elsewhere in the world, please add $5 USD)<br>
-heavy duty badge holder to protect your painting (lanyard not included)<br>
-printed name tag displaying your faction/character/guild/server as shown


If you’re interested, you can [see my original post here](http://manalicious.wordpress.com/2013/05/08/watercolour-blizzcon-badges/) (it has some more bonus artwork) and it also includes the submission form for requesting a badge. Thanks for your interest and for supporting me in my work! I’m looking forward to creating some more of these for folks.
