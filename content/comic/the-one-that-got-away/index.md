Funny story about panel 5 on this page – without meaning to, I had unconsciously modeled Four’s pose after Spider-Man comic I read ***twenty-four years ago***. And then, after realizing this fact, I was able to identify, track down and download said comic to examine the angle of the pose. God bless the internet.


IT’S WARLORDS LAUNCH TOMORROW! If you’re taking the day off to enjoy it, make sure you have some snacks and drinks to keep you going! And if you run into one of those inevitable quest chokepoints – like the Alliance airship quest on Mists launch day – try not to get too stressed out. 


See you on Draenor!
