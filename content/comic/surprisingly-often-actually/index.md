From Draenor With Love launched November 1, 2011, which means itâ€™s been an *entire year!* ðŸ˜€ I am pretty pleased that we put out a comic each and every week, even when life kicked us around a bit, or when one of us was traveling. Thanks to everyone whoâ€™s read our stuff over the past year! We appreciate your visits, your comments, your retweets, all of it!


Also, a special thanks to Dee, Ayms/Mits, and Walks, who gave us awesome guest strips! The streak would be not exist without your creative endeavors! /highfive


When we were discussing an anniversary strip, we thought it might be funny to tally up whose character(s) had appeared in more comics â€“ would it be Rades? Or would it be the duo of Vidyala/Millya? However, as we flipped back we realized (with vast amusement on my part, and scowling disapproval on Vidâ€™s) that GARROSH, of all people, was our third-most-used character.


â€¦what can we say? Whether you like his in-game persona or not, heâ€™s pure gold in comic form. And Vid is just so GOOD at drawing him!


Oh Garrosh. Whatever will we do for inspiration after weâ€™ve killed you? /sniff


And because I know youâ€™re curious, hereâ€™s all of Garroshâ€™s comic appearances:
