Hey guys, Vid’s been crit by real life this week, so send her warm thoughts because until she’s back, you’re stuck with my terrible WoW Model Viewer comics!


Last night Blizzard released an [updated Mists of Pandaria talent calculator](https://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/feature/talent-calculator), complete with new baseline talents. One of the new baseline Warlock talents was Demonic Portal, as pictured above. Needless to say, the Portal comparisons were instant and furious! So I figured it was an appropriate time to break out ye old Undercity Companion Cube image from this year’s Love is in the Air seasonal event.


(If you don’t get the joke, this is Chell, the main character of Portal.)
