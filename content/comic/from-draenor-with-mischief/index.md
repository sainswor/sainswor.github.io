This is the special prize strip **Cymre** of [Bubbles of Mischief](http://www.bubblesofmischief.com/) won by taking 1st place in the Great Blog Noblegarden Egg Hunt! 


Congratulations Cymre! We hope you enjoy your guest appearance!


Cymre maintains an amazing gallery of World of Warcraft rare spawns on her blog – aka, “Silver Dragons” – so we thought, hey, what better way to celebrate her egg-hunting victory than with some Silver Dragon love of her own?


Of course, to the REST of us, rare spawns are highly coveted! Special drops, bonus bursts of XP, achievements, you name it! I know I personally can never pass up a rare spawn I happen across…after all, they might drop something great for transmogrifying!


Anyway, Cymre also has great screenshot galleries of scenic WoW locations, transmog outfits, Mists of Pandaria beta stuff, and more! So do yourself a favor and camp her (blog). You won’t regret it!
