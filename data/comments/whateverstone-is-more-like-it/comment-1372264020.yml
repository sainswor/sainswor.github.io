comment: '<p>Metzen is decent at making cool worlds, but horrible at actual stories and character development. There are so many wierd character/story 180s in blizzard games now it’s ridiculous – like Raynor and Kerrigan’s retconned romance that never existed or was even hinted at in starcraft 1 – instead, Raynor swore to kill her. Now he’s pining over her. Ugh… &gt;.&lt;</p>'
