A few people were asking what Rades was pouring out of that bag back on <a href="/comic/stealth/">Page #80</a> â€” I told you itâ€™d be explained! Granted, maybe he originally intended to use it just as a distraction, but I think it still served its purpose. (We also love seeing your comments trying to predict things that havenâ€™t been revealed or explained yet in the story â€” we always get a kick when you guess right!)


As for this pageâ€¦sometimes when I send Vid the comic storyboard I get some good-natured groans if itâ€™s a particularly complex layout. I really donâ€™t know what came over me with this one. But Vidâ€™s a champ and nailed it, like always. ðŸ˜€
