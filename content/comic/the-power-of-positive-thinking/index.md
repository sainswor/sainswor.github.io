Speaking of going back to Pandaria, I too have found myself back in Kun-Lai and Halfhill lately. Since Brawler’s Guild is going away in Legion, I’ve been trying to get all the special quests to unlock the Brawler’s Guild challenge bosses required for [Collect Your Deck](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=8339/collect-your-deck) — partially for the achievement, but also for the shirts you get for beating those bosses. Gotta gear up for the wardrobe!
