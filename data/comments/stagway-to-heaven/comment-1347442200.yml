comment: '<p>A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. </p><p>At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: “What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant stag travel form.” </p><p>The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, “What is the stag standing on?” “You’re very clever, young man, very clever,” said the old lady. “But it’s stags all the way down!”</p>'
