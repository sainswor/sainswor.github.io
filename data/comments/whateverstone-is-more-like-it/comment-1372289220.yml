comment: '<p>The Raynor/Kerrigan romance made sense to me. I’ve been baffled at the outcry from some sectors. They definitely had some sort of relationship in SC1, but it wasn’t very defined by the story. (Said story was admittedly fairly bare bones, yet very awesome anyway.)</p><p>I find it entirely realistic that four years later, after no progress against a human enemy (Mengsk), with dwindling funds and frankly nothing going right, that Raynor would be more inclined to dwell on the good times with Kerrigan than the bad times with the Queen of Blades.</p><p>And….uh…am I supposed to say something about Garrosh? Oh. Hmm. Uh, well, the Mana Bomb was dropped on a military target apparently after civilians were evacuated. Is that still at odds with Garrosh’s character in Stonetalon?</p>'
