Hey all, no FDWL update this week as Vid has some RL family stuff going on. (This isn’t an April First gag.) 


However, [Blizzard did release their special patch notes for today!](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18486737/new-garrison-feature-tindr-for-followers-3-27-2015) As always, they’re amazing. but also check out that first screenshot!!  😀


FDWL will be back next week like normal – think it’s maybe time to check in on Rades, we haven’t seen him in a while! Until then, have a great day, and as male Forsaken NPCs say, “Trust no one.”
