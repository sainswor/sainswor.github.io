comment: '<p>That’s a bit of an over simplistic judgement. It’s really easy to say that her problems are the result of external factors, but did we never think that it was her lack of tact that caused problems for those men? </p><p>She sleeps with Arthas then won’t stop following him around long enough for him to breathe. She tells everyone that they’re getting married. Is it any surprise that he runs off to Northrend?</p><p>Thrall tries being nice to her, and her drama queen relationship with her dad ends up with him trying to Kill Thrall over it. </p><p>She has such daddy issues that she literally hires a guy to kill him. Daddy issues, much?</p><p>When she gets Pear Harbor’ed at Theramore, Rhonin dies to save her life. Is she grateful? Does she spend the next month or so caring for the family he left behind? No. She doesn’t even mention him as a reason she wants revenge. Because it’s all about her. </p><p>No wonder she didn’t like Kael’thas, he wasn’t in danger at the time, and Jaina’s obviously only attracted to danger and controversy. Kael knew it too. That’s probably why he decided to Join the Horde and start stealing beings of light. </p><p>NOTE: this was written to be humorous, or ironic, not to justify/place blame. I’m merely pointing out that motivations can sometimes be… wishy washy.</p>'
