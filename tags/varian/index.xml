This is utter nonsense. The problem isn‚Äôt with Jaina, the problem is that the men in her life are just plain jerks.
Have you actually LISTENED to the crap these guys say? It‚Äôs pretty sad when Garrosh of all people has treated her with more dignity and respect than her so-called close friends.</description></item><item><title>You Know He Would, Part Two</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/you-know-he-would-part-two/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2013 12:23:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/you-know-he-would-part-two/</guid><description>The inevitable result of last week‚Äôs devious scheme.
(Really, this moment was so amazing, how could we NOT give it the full-comic spotlight it deserves??)
You know, in-game Garrosh is unpleasant and thoroughly unlikeable, and Blizzard is going to great lengths to portray him as an absolute monster. But I‚Äôm a big fan of THIS Garrosh, the one who isn‚Äôt concerned about world domination or wiping cities off the map, but just sticking it to Varian and being a general pain in the ass.</description></item><item><title>He Knows</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/he-knows/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2012 17:46:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/he-knows/</guid><description>Hey, he IS a Prophet, after all. Also, I just need to point this out while Rades is gone: Orcs are currently on the very naughty list.
But the idea of Velen as Greatfather Winter and the faction leaders as little kids was actually all Rades‚Äô, so you can‚Äôt accuse me of bias in this case. We agreed that it even makes sense, when you think about it ‚Äì to a draenei who is thousands of years old maybe the rest of us would seem like children.</description></item><item><title>Surprisingly Often, Actually</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/surprisingly-often-actually/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2012 10:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/surprisingly-often-actually/</guid><description>From Draenor With Love launched November 1, 2011, which means it‚Äôs been an entire year! üòÄ I am pretty pleased that we put out a comic each and every week, even when life kicked us around a bit, or when one of us was traveling. Thanks to everyone who‚Äôs read our stuff over the past year! We appreciate your visits, your comments, your retweets, all of it!
Also, a special thanks to Dee, Ayms/Mits, and Walks, who gave us awesome guest strips!</description></item><item><title>There Will Be Blood</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/there-will-be-blood/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2012 09:05:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/there-will-be-blood/</guid><description>From a recent Mists beta build: Glyph of Gushing Wound.
WTF is it with WARRIOR glyphs in Mists? Cripes. Lighting themselves on fire, lightning strikes, flocks of crows, and now MORE BLOOD? Blizz is sure giving them some pretty fun cosmetic options!
Also, these might seriously be my favorite type of strip. I don‚Äôt know if Vid was quite as big a fan of this particular one though.

Like we said last week‚Ä¶Warrior glyphs in Mists = THE COOLEST.
Some news about the next few weeks! This weekend, we‚Äôll be attending a Comic Expo in Calgary! Excitement! Our strip next week will be something based off the Expo, we hope. Then, the week after that we plan on presenting the special guest strip for Great Blog Noblegarden Egg Hunt! So keep your eyes peeled!</description></item><item><title>The Art of War, Part One</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-art-of-war-part-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2012 08:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-art-of-war-part-one/</guid><description>A Glyph that causes a lightning strike?
‚Ä¶I have a sudden urge to play a warrior in Mists.
Seriously though, it‚Äôs terrific that Blizzard is giving us all these new fun cosmetic glyphs. They‚Äôre little touches, but damn are they cool.
My personal favorite so far? That would be Glyph of the Geist. BECAUSE GEISTS ARE AWESOME.
(In other news, I think Vid is going to revolt if I make her draw Garrosh again.</description></item><item><title>Resurrection Sickness</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/resurrection-sickness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2012 11:11:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/resurrection-sickness/</guid><description>Everyone‚Äôs been buzzing about the new &amp;amp; improved Scroll of Resurrection, and why not? A free level 80, realm transfer AND faction transfer? Just for coming back to the game? Yeah, it‚Äôs no wonder the new Scroll offer has been so popular.
Of course, we all know what‚Äôs REALLY behind the Scroll frenzy.
SPECTRAL MOUNTS.
Awww yeah. That‚Äôs the kind of incentive that gets RESULTS.
PS: Did you know Stormwind really does have a War Room?</description></item></channel></rss>
