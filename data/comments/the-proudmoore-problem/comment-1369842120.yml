comment: '<p>Early on in the Shattering novel, Varian &amp; Jaina are having an argument about (I believe) Horde attacks or raids. I think Jaina’s stance is that they need to trust Thrall, and Varian lashes back with the quote in the comic. It might be paraphrased but that’s essentially what he said to her, tossing Arthas in her face and dismissing her opinions because of prior “poor judgement.”</p>'
