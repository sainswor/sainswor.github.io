comment: '<p>Haha. Good guilt trip Sablemane. ðŸ˜€   He has a good point though. On Draenor, the old gods on Azeroth didnâ€™t have the same connection to the Black Flight since o0n Draenor, the Black Flight arenâ€™t Earth Warders, but just ordinary black dragons. Albeit powerful ones.</p><p> @ Cygnia Different old gods and the Black Flight isnâ€™t as connected to Draenor or its remnants like they are/were to Azeroth. So even though some old gods can be summoned to Draenor (MU or AU Draenor), unless they are the same old gods as on Azeroth, old god whispers would not be heard by the Black Flight on Draenor.</p><p> Will we be seeing the Netherwing dragons?</p>'
