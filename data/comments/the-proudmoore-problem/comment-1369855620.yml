comment: '<p>You know, you could look at that as a critique over her relationship with Arthas, or you could look at it as her judgement of Orcs in general.  In the WC3 TFT bonus campaign she vouched for the New Horde under Thrall’s rule, and Orgrimmar exists because of her intervention.  She judged them to be good enough to exist and be given a chance.  In turn they brutally attacked and murdered their neighbors.  Not everything about Jaina’s past is about Arthas.<br>But yeah, the entire Horde/Alliance conflict currently exists because Jaina thought she could trust all Orcs because of Thrall.  Her disobedience and the subsequent murder of her father in an attempt to do what she thought was right only led to her city (which was composed largely of survivors from Lorderon when the Scourge plague first swept the land) being nuked.  The city wasn’t razed and pillaged like in previous wars, it was just turned to dust and nearly everyone inside was killed.</p><p>None the less, the joke was cute, although you left out Kalecgos, and there was one other dude that she had been involved with, or at least it was implied, but I forget who.  I thought Kalecgos treated her fairly well.  Arthas technically treated her well too (thinking back to her introduction to her introduction in WC3 as well as the Arthas book), he never blamed her for leaving him at Stratholme.  She on the other hand was quite clingy to him, even after he turned and became a death knight and then Lich King.</p>'
