comment: '<p>Also, Garrosh going after Theramore was a dumb tactical decision… he should have kicked all the little stuff out first… but maybe that’s just the game’s weird way of moving through time… after all, we go thru over and over defeating the same bosses in instances, quest areas reset, and stuff that happened years ago and is over is still happening ‘today(?)’… i feel like everything is in its’ own time bubble…</p>'
