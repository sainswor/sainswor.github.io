comment: '<p>I never really liked Garrosh and always thought he was one step away from going mad with power (the dislike was formed when he threw the attack plans in the fire and was a selfish #$@$@ back in BC, and the second opinion cropped up the moment I saw him in Wrath and heard him talking there), but I do agree that his character development has been rather rushed. Apparently Blizz confessed that they had planned one more expansion with him ruling before the expansion where we dethroned him, so there was supposed to be a extra expansion of development, and it really shows.</p><p>With that said- I don’t really find anything he does unbelievable. He was racist from day 1, and showed himself so entrenched in his own issues he could never look beyond them outside of ‘orcs’ and ‘non-orcs’. Non-orcs being weak and enemies for the most part. Of course I read a lot of the written material, which does fill in some blanks as mentioned above. (They really need to improve that key lore info in game aspect).</p><p>OF COURSE, I play primarily Goblins and Trolls and Draenei. Those are the races that interest me. So from early on I was noticing how he treated those races before all else. </p><p>To me he is pretty much the Hitler and Stalin of WoW at this point, and considering at least Hitler was born of crippling insecurity on his part, makes sense. I DO wish that Blizz did… how can I say this. Hm. I guess I wished they showed how completely inexcusable his actions were, apply this to the broader “everyone needs to get their stuff together” theme of WoW to prepare for the Legion, and show how he could have been good but how pursuing dogmatically the strength for ORCS he failed in his blindness to all else.</p>'
