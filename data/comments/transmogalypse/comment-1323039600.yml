comment: '<p>I also started collecting the purple Judgement set (along with the Wrath and Might recolors), but then I started playing around a bit with other stuff I owned, and realized that the helm and shoulders of the white recolor of paladins’ t5 works brilliantly with the rest of the set. Top it off with a Bastion of Light and a Hammer of Atonement and you’ve got yourself an epic set. Now I’m considering collecting the original Judgement set, but with Merciless helm and shoulders, so basically it will be an orange version of the aforementioned set. This way I’ll have two variations of my unique and beautiful set for my two specs. ^_^</p>'
