comment: '<p>House Wrynn Halberd? That is a quest reward for the final quest in the Vanessa Van Cleef questline in Westfall, isnâ€™t it? Iâ€™ve usually picked the claymore as a reward there because I like the model. And before 5.2 there werenâ€™t really any strength polearms around.</p><p>The reason I thought it was the Icier Barbed Spear is because it would fit with Fourâ€™s prizefighter career thing.<br>Though itâ€™s possible that started with the Brawlerâ€™s Guild I suppose.</p><p>Well. Thereâ€™s Blackrock Mountain from EK. And the Desolace/Feralas/Tanaris (Caverns of Time) link from Kalimdor could point to a Stonemaul, or possibly Dunemaul, connection.<br>Unless sheâ€™s a rebelling/exiled Gordok ogre.</p><p>So many possibilities. ðŸ™‚</p><p>I like the Tranquilizer btw, becuase itâ€™s a cool model as well as a unique one. My only gripe with it is the green colour which makes it very hard to match with any armor sets.</p>'
