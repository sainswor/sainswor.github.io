It’s a good thing hitting the button on LFR Ultraxion isn’t necessary to beat the fight, because if it was, I don’t think a single LFR group would ever kill him. Like, seriously, it’s NOT THAT HARD, PEOPLE. PUSH THE DAMN BUTTON. IT’S RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR SCREEN, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. 


But no. It’s enough to make a healer tear their hair out in frustration.


In other news, here is a snippet of the From Draenor creative process at work:


**Rades:** I think it needs some underbrush, in the background?<br>
**Rades:** like whatever trees they have there<br>
**Rades:** alternately, explosions<br>
**Rades:** maybe bullet casings flying out of gun?<br>
**Vid:** oh does that happen?<br>
**Rades:** DOES THAT HAPPEN<br>
**Vid:** hahaha man<br>
**Vid:** I’m pretty sure the gun is also completely wrong<br>
**Rades:** haha<br>
**Vid:** I don’t know how a gun works<br>
**Vid:** I’m like, huh I think it’s like, look there’s a holdy thing here<br>
**Rades:** you have the front ammo clip, that’s enough to show it’s a gun<br>
**Vid:** wtf is an ammo clip, did I draw that<br>
**Rades:** …<br>
**Vid:** nevermind, hahaha
