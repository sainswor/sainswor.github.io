This week in lieu of a comic we have instead a quick painting I did. I’ve had family stuff come up that I had to deal with, it’s sad but sometimes life wins out. The average comic takes me around five+ hours to draw and unfortunately this week I didn’t have those hours. Back when we started FDWL they used to take me eight! I haven’t gotten that much faster, I have simplified the art significantly though.


This was done with water colour, working largely wet-in-wet. I didn’t do a sketch first, I just started putting down paint and seeing what it wanted to do, and then picked out the details of Vid and Rades. Despite how I try to sneak Millya into as many strips as possible, they ARE the main characters after all. We’ll see you next week with a fresh comic, hopefully this will tide you all over until then.
