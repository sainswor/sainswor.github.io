Confession: We realize the Tushui Alliance lion isn’t *technically* the symbol of the Brawler’s Guild, but the Brawler’s guild doesn’t actually HAVE a symbol! We checked the arena, the shirts, the NPCs, nothing. 


But you know what? Both Horde and Alliance began running their Brawler’s Guild at around the same time as the two Pandaren factions joined up, so maybe Aysa and Ji brought the tradition with them.


(Shhhh, just go with it.)
