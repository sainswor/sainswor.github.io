comment: '<p>It’s like the Magtheridon fight all over again it seems. Back in TBC, 5 players had to simultaneously click the friggin’ cubes or Magtheridon would blast wave the raid into oblivion. Every patch in TBC that nerfed Magtheridon, we would joke that “Magtheridon would click cube for you”. This wasn’t a hard part of the fight but people tend to be mouth-breathers when it comes to clicking on objects during a fight.</p>'
