comment: '<p>eh, that’s one I keep on my log and do throughout the intervening time, which means I only get credit for it half the time but really?  Unless I have time to be out hammering dailies during the festival, the only time I’ve gotten them all within the week was when I was farming spiders to gather leather to make PVP mail gear for my daughter.  It’s weird to be collecting trophies – but not unusual in Azeroth.  I figured they went along with gnome stew, y’no?  (seriously, cata “delicacies” are something totally else…)</p>'
