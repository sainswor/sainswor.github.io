Were they serious? Was this an elaborate joke? How much more like Pokemon could this possibly be? But without question, the most important possibility was the potential hilarity of absurd pet matchups, such as Alliance Balloon vs. Horde Balloon, or Enchanted Broom vs. Magic Lamp. Can you say EXCITEMENT??
Personally, I’m banking on my Toxic Wasteling.</description></item><item><title>Rare Spawn</title><link>https://sainswor.github.io/comic/rare-spawn-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2011 06:21:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://sainswor.github.io/comic/rare-spawn-3/</guid><description>I’m not especially good at keeping secrets. So the fact that you are only seeing this, now, after over a month of loving work is nothing short of a miracle. The idea of doing a webcomic wasn’t a new one for Rades and I – we’d talked about it before, sometime last year – but the time wasn’t right. We were on different pages about what a comic should be (I was thinking epic story, he was thinking gag) and so we just shelved it.</description></item></channel></rss>
