It’s that time of year again! Perhaps you recognize the new and improved Greatfather Winter from [last year’s escapades](/comic/winter-fail-part-one)?


I love everything about this strip, but particularly tiny adorable Rades and Vid hanging off of Kovok there. Look for these as our Twitter avatars for a while!

(You may also be amused that an in-depth discussion about Klaxxi anatomical features and the specific societal roles of Klaxxi of different body types preceded the completion of this comic. COMICS = SRS BSNS.)


I’ve also happened across a new thing to include in the comic to make Vid curse my name…something that ISN’T Garrosh. Bugs!


**Vid:** say why is this giant Kovok bug even flying? why is this a thing<br>
**Vid:** adgskdlfj; bugs<br>
**Rades:** it flies!<br>
**Vid:** gross, haha<br>
**Rades:** did you not do the quest for it where you free it?<br>
**Rades:** it flies and it is awesome<br>
**Vid:** I’m not freeing any bugs!!


RACIST AGAINST BUGS!
