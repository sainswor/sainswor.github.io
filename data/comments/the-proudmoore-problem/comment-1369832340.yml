comment: '<p>Also, when Kael shows up unexpectedly in Icecrown and confronts Arthas in WC3, he says “This is for Quel’Thalas…and other insults.” Which is a pretty great line for the twisted parallel relationship the two princes have and what they’ve gone through, but still shows how Kael regards his relationship with Jaina. Not even that he feels jilted or heartbroken, but that his ego was bruised. And that’s pretty telling.</p>'
