comment: '<p>I’m convinced that the filth-pool is a kind of low-tech plague breeding experiment – kinda like the Undercity with more stone-age lizard-men. When their pathogens are complete (and the saurok, thanks to continual exposure, are entirely immune) a carpet of roaches and animate slime will sweep out across the Isle of Thunder, subjugating all in its path. The Skumblade will then descend into the Throne of Thunder and pillage the dead raid bosses for epics.</p><p>And after that, the rest of Azeroth!</p>'
