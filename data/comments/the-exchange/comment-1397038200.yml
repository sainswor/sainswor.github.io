It’s like with the Steamwheedle Cartel, always try trading before resorting to force.<br>I see complications in the future though. Something tells me those spheres won’t work quite as intended on the Sha.</p><p>And I can also see a lot of shady people wanting to get their hands on an imprisoned Sha, for research purposes.</p><p>Quite like how Rades and Vidyala look on this page too btw.</p>'
