[Vidâ€™s turn!](http://wowhead.com/item=20569)  ðŸ˜‰


For those unfamiliar with what Rades is talking about, heâ€™s referring to the fact that Rexxar, Volâ€™jin and Chen are old war buddies. Years ago (in Warcraft III) they fought together, for Thrallâ€™s Horde, against the then-leader of Theramore, Daelin Proudmoore (Jainaâ€™s father), who hated the Horde and wanted to respark the Horde-Alliance war. Considering the situation and players involved in the Siege of Orgrimmar, it seems a bit of a similar situation. I wonder what Rexxar would think of whatâ€™s going down, way over there in Durotar. 


(If youâ€™d like to read more about Rexxarâ€™s Azerothian adventures, I wrote up a bit about his time with [Know Your Lore article about him!](http://wow.joystiq.com/2007/06/14/know-your-lore-rexxar/))
