Y’know, I asked Vid to do something special artistically for the middle two panels, and HOLY CRAP did she nail it! Those panels might be my favorite artwork in all of FDWL so far. 


Next week will mark the end of our first chapter! (Will all chapters be the same length? We don’t know yet.) We hope you’ve been enjoying the story so far! Now that we’ve laid the groundwork, it’s time to get this show on the road!  /rubs hands eagerly


Next stop: ***DRAENOR.***
