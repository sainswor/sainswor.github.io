comment: '<p>I’m still questing in the Dread Wastes. Like Ghostlands on acid is a very apt description of the place! My Night Elf hunter has totally gone native Pandaren, so she’s a little leery of the Klaxxi, but I like them. The little guy who sends you out on all the quests to bang a tuning fork on amber crystals is the best NPC I’ve encountered in that zone. Poor guy, click him enough times and he starts crying and asking you why you’re a mean person for poking him repeatedly. Plus he sounds like Zim and I have such a soft spot for that cartoon.</p>'
