‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Pandaren board game. The object is for both players to win.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ridiculous! Why would you even play!?‚Äù
That‚Äôs it for Chapter One! The groundwork is set, the plot points have been laid out. Now ‚Äì rubs hands together eagerly ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to have some fun.
We will be taking a short break before starting in on the next leg of the story, to allow for Christmas holidays and whatnot.</description></item><item><title>Where The Heart Is</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/where-the-heart-is/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2013 03:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/where-the-heart-is/</guid><description>Y‚Äôknow, I asked Vid to do something special artistically for the middle two panels, and HOLY CRAP did she nail it! Those panels might be my favorite artwork in all of FDWL so far.
Next week will mark the end of our first chapter! (Will all chapters be the same length? We don‚Äôt know yet.) We hope you‚Äôve been enjoying the story so far! Now that we‚Äôve laid the groundwork, it‚Äôs time to get this show on the road!</description></item><item><title>Quest Accepted</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/quest-accepted/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2013 04:14:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/quest-accepted/</guid><description>I always find it funny when our plot details are actually accurate/based off the real characters. For example, Rades the WoW toon really IS an honorary member of the Consortium, having reached Exalted status with them way, way back (I think I wanted the tabard? or maybe one of their engineering schematics). On the other hand, Vid never did the rep grind for them, and we‚Äôll see this reflected later on in the comic.</description></item><item><title>Naar-who?</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/naar-who/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 02:14:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/naar-who/</guid><description>Look at us! Blizzcon week and not even missing a beat? YEAH! But seriously, Vid worked like a maniac to get a few strips done ahead of time, so she definitely earned the vacation time! It certainly wouldn‚Äôt have been the end of the world to have a filler strip or two, but we‚Äôre pretty pleased that we didn‚Äôt have to resort to that!
As for Blizzcon itself ‚Äì WOW! Exciting stuff!</description></item><item><title>The Magic Word</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-magic-word/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2013 02:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-magic-word/</guid><description>It‚Äôs Blizzcon week! Hope everyone who‚Äôs attending the con or watching via Virtual Ticket has a great time! If you‚Äôre there, keep an eye out for Vid ‚Äì she‚Äôll be the one with a bunch of FDWL stickers and business cards! üòâ</description></item><item><title>Awkward</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/awkward/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2013 02:39:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/awkward/</guid><description>One of the hazards in being an insatiably curious two-year-old dragon and knowing very little about history is not recognizing the kind of questions you simply do not ask in civilized company.
Some readers have asked us for a while now about Vid and Rades and their connection to Draenor, so here‚Äôs a few answers!</description></item><item><title>Attention Span</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/attention-span/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2013 02:34:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/attention-span/</guid><description>Something you should know about engineers: we‚Äôre constantly keeping an eye out for cliffs, staircases and towers to hurl ourselves from that we might use our gadgets to float safely to the ground in style.
Ask the engineer in your raid. They‚Äôll verify this.</description></item><item><title>Oh, It‚Äôs You</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/oh-its-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 02:49:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/oh-its-you/</guid><description>If you think about it, Wrathion probably IS pretty bothered by what happened to the Vale. It‚Äôs just a stone‚Äôs throw away from the Tavern in the Mists! That has to be horrible for property values.</description></item><item><title>It Probably Happens A Lot</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/it-probably-happens-a-lot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2013 15:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/it-probably-happens-a-lot/</guid><description>Hunters know what I‚Äôm talking about.

Oh Garrosh, look at all the trouble you‚Äôre causing.</description></item><item><title>Repercussions</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/repercussions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2013 14:06:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/repercussions/</guid><description>Starting to get underway! The impact of Garrosh‚Äôs actions in the Vale. Major events are about to be set in motion.
Apologies for the disarray of the site design right now. We updated the WordPress version and it broke everything, just like it ALWAYS DOES (seriously, it actually breaks every time we update) but thankfully the damage doesn‚Äôt seem TOO severe this time. Hopefully it shouldn‚Äôt be too long before we get everything back to how it should be.</description></item><item><title>Chapter One: Despair</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/chapter-one-despair/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 14:06:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/chapter-one-despair/</guid><description>It‚Äôs an exciting day for From Draenor With Love! After nearly two years of making this comic, we felt we were ready to tackle some new challenges.
What does this mean? Our name is staying the same. The comic will still be about Rades and Vid. It will be an ongoing story from week to week. The format will be less static four-panel and more graphic novel. I also made some changes personally, going back to my roots a bit as it were to ink the comic by hand rather than entirely digitally.</description></item></channel></rss>
