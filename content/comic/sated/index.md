Whoa, whoa, where did 2013 come from? It totally snuck up and [Ambushed] us when we werenâ€™t expecting it. Weâ€™ve both been a little busy the last few days with RL travel, festivities and the ever pleasant-but-emotionally-draining family visits, but weâ€™ll be back on pace next week with new stuff! 


Also, I donâ€™t know if weâ€™ve ever mentioned this, but weâ€™re always open to ideas and suggestions! Many of our strips are inspired by actual conversations or experiences weâ€™ve had in-game, so if you come across something that you think we absolutely should know about, let us know in a comment, or tweet us at @fromdraenor! No guarantees, of course, but weâ€™ll certainly take a look!


As for resolutions? Well, Iâ€™d like to joke about how I intend to keep throwing Garrosh scripts at Vid until she screams, but itâ€™s going to be pretty hard NOT to do this when heâ€™s such an integral lore figure right now! We work with what we are given, and what we are being given is GARROSH GARROSH GARROSH.


Big G aside though, Iâ€™m going to try to be better at answering comments! We really do appreciate you guys, especially if you take the time to leave us a note, so expect more frequent responses from here on out! Letâ€™s chat! ðŸ˜€
