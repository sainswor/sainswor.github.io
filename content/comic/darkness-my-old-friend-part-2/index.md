(I don’t know that we’ll post a song for every page, but I figure if we have one that fits, we might as well!)


Ah, the Broken. You can’t really delve into draenei and orc lore without visiting them. If you’re unfamiliar with Broken lore, you should absolutely go read Micky Neilson’s short story [Unbroken](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/short-story/unbroken/1). It’s a fantastic read. Just be warned that *our* Broken, are not necessarily like Nobundo…
