When Vid &amp; Rades were making their travel plans <a href="/comic/hit-m-for-map/">way back at the start of Chapter 2</a>, there were some comments wondering about Sablemane and Wrathion. These queries continued when Sablemane actually showed up <a href="/comic/old-friends/">on page 25.</a> Well, trust us, these two meeting and interacting has ALWAYS been one of the stories we’ve wanted to tell in FDWL. They’re such interesting personalities, with such great potential!


In other news, thanks to some very generous [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/fromdraenor) patrons, we’re looking to get our website looked at sometime soon! (In the meantime, we’ve updated our Characters page, but that’s about the extent of our web skills.) Huge thanks to Jorge, Chris, Matt, Mary, Kristy and Faith for your support! You lovely people put the &lt;3 in FDWL.
