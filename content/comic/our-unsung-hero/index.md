From Draenor presents, [Real Azerothian Geniuses.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCxMBgPF7rc)


Today we salute you, Mr. Lamp Hum Sound Creator Guy.


You work tirelessly to capture the tranquil sound of a summer breeze or the frantic buzz of fireflies trapped in a jar, just to make our weary trek through the wild a little less scary.


In the darkest of nights, we pause on our journey, wondering if that subtle rustling we just heard was one of your masterpieces singing its peaceful song of illumination, or a horrible flesh-eating zombie lurking in the bushes. 


Usually, we shake our heads and smile, breathing a sigh of relief when we realize it was just a lamp. Oh, those mischievous lamps. Other times, we get devoured by ghouls, but hey, you can’t win ’em all, right?


So here’s to you, Mr. Lamp Hum Sound Creator Guy.


You light up our lives…with the sounds of freedom.
