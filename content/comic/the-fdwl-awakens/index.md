Happy Star Wars Day, and May the Fourth be with you!


We donâ€™t normally skip a week for a special page like this, but when we noticed the date coincidence a few weeks back, we just couldnâ€™t pass up the opportunity to have a little fun. And now, after seeing what Vid came up with, I think we definitely made the right call. (Sorry Poe, there just wasnâ€™t room, buddy!)


Patreon supporters, a higher-res version of todayâ€™s page will be available soon! Enjoy! ðŸ˜€
