comment: '<p>Ok, lessee here, from left to right:<br>– Obsidian Edged Blade (Garr, usually, Molten Core)<br>– Coldrage Dagger (Razorfen Downs, or same model with a different name, or, possibly, Cross Pommel Dagger, a green drop from Outland)<br>– Blackhand Doomsaw (Rend Blackhand, UBRS) or Lantressor’s Warblade (Outland quest reward in Nagrand from Lantressor)<br>– The Tranquilizer (quest reward from Calming the Kodo, Desolace)<br>– Barbarous Blade (King Gordok, Dire Maul)<br>– Dreadlord’s Blade (Mal’ganis, Culling of Stratholme)<br>– Icier Barbed Spear (actually a halberd, one of the rewards from the last fight in the Amphitheatre of Anguish in Zul’Drak.)</p><p>Have I mentioned I’m a transmog junkie? And that I have a DK, three paladins and a ton of warriors?<br>Recognized all the blades right away except the dagger. Had to look up the name of the Tranquilizer though, since I just recognized the model and not the name.<br>Still unsure about the dagger. Only have one rogue that I don’t play much.</p><p>Very curious if this is just showing off some weapons from WoW or if there are deliberate hints at Four’s past in that arsenal…</p><p>Also, what are the Defias doing in Deadwind Pass? Pushed out of Elwynn and Duskwood by the guards/Night Watch/adventurers?</p>'
