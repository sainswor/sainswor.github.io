We should be back with Chapter 3 next week! Until then, enjoy the script for a page we never ended up doing: Archimonde Crossing.


When Animal Crossing: New Leaf came out, both Vid and I were enjoying it so much we wanted to do a FDWL comic about it. We had a few different ideas, including one about how hilarious it is when you shake a tree in Animal Crossing, hoping for money or furniture, and instead you get ***AN ANGRY SWARM OF BEES***. 


In the end we went with <a href="/comic/there-are-two-types-of-people/">this comic</a> for our Animal Crossing strip. We decided not to use the other ones, since we didnâ€™t want to talk about a game that not everyone was playing for TOO long. 


So, enjoy this behind-the-scenes look at our scripting process! This is the exact script, unchanged, that I sent to Vid, random thoughts and sentence fragments and all. Now you can see what she has to deal with on a weekly basis.  ðŸ˜‰
