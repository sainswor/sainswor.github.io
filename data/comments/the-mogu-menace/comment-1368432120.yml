comment: '<p>Almost as bad as killing hundreds of Nagrand ogres for their necklaces. With a drop rate of about 1 in 4, thousands of Ogres died for me to get Exalted with Kurenai. *hack slash squelch” ” hmm you don’t wear a necklace, onto the next victim”. </p><p>Likewise the Naga for the sporelings “They’re like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM!”</p><p>I must add though that this was during my fury warrior days, I wouldn’t do such a thing now I am a peace loving resto druid *cough* *kicks pile of winterfall furbolg under the rug*</p>'
