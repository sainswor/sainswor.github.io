I‚Äôm totally pumped, but I‚Äôm also dreading it! I want to see the cool new raid content and bosses, but I don‚Äôt WANT to kill Nazgrim! I don‚Äôt WANT to kill the Paragons!
And I don‚Äôt want to kill Garrosh!
(He‚Äôs a major From Draenor With Love character, after all!)
Speaking of the comic, this strip marks an important milestone for us. Starting next week, everything is changing!</description></item><item><title>The Real Twelve</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-real-twelve/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2013 09:02:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-real-twelve/</guid><description>Hey, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much of a stretch! Rades is an accomplished engineer, he could undoubtedly keep a TARDIS running, and he could accomplish so much with a sonic screwdriver! I think Vid would make a great companion, though she could be the Doctor just as easily.
I did this art awhile ago and thought considering this Sunday‚Äôs announcement, using it now would be pretty timely. The opportunity to put Rades in a dapper suit jacket and bow tie was too good to pass up.</description></item><item><title>Dig Dug Bug</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/dig-dug-bug/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2013 11:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/dig-dug-bug/</guid><description>If it‚Äôs not a bind-on-account piece of gear to mega-buff alts, a fun vanity item to bust out during killshots, or hilariously unpredictable hearthstone replacements that randomly take you all over Azeroth, WE DON‚ÄôT WANT IT.</description></item><item><title>Tourist‚Äôs Guide to Ihgaluk Crag</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/tourists-guide-to-ihgaluk-crag/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2013 10:27:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/tourists-guide-to-ihgaluk-crag/</guid><description>Yet More Things To Do and See While in The Crag:

If you‚Äôre not familiar, ACNL is a kind of life simulator game for the Nintendo 3DS that has been sweeping through the WoW twitter community like a wildfire. I played an earlier Animal Crossing title on the Gamecube back in the day.¬†In terms of gameplay it‚Äôs pretty basic: Grow/harvest fruit, plant flowers, laugh at things your neighbours say, fish and catch bugs, dig up fossils, design clothes.</description></item><item><title>A Quick AFK</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/a-quick-afk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2013 18:24:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/a-quick-afk/</guid><description>This week in lieu of a comic we have instead a quick painting I did. I‚Äôve had family stuff come up that I had to deal with, it‚Äôs sad but sometimes life wins out. The average comic takes me around five+ hours to draw and unfortunately this week I didn‚Äôt have those hours. Back when we started FDWL they used to take me eight! I haven‚Äôt gotten that much faster, I have simplified the art significantly though.</description></item><item><title>Blizzcon Badges!</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/blizzcon-badges/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/blizzcon-badges/</guid><description>Do you need a little something to set you apart from the crowd at Blizzcon? Would you like a small piece of art to call your own and remember all the good times you had at the convention? I‚Äôve been painting up just the thing!
These little paintings are painted on thick, high-quality Arches watercolour paper with Winsor &amp;amp; Newton watercolours. In a world of art that‚Äôs increasingly digital, I find I am loving going back to my roots and painting with brushes and pigments again.</description></item><item><title>Our New Favorite Boss</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-new-favorite-boss/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2013 07:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-new-favorite-boss/</guid><description>Could this really be that far off, after seeing Tortos?
There‚Äôs been a lot of interesting raid boss mechanics ‚Äì vehicles, flying, spirit realms ‚Äì but few things are as satisfying or funny as just hauling off and punting a giant turtle at an even BIGGER turtle.
Bravo, Blizzard encounter design team. Bravo.</description></item><item><title>Fortune and Glory, Kid</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/fortune-and-glory-kid/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2013 08:37:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/fortune-and-glory-kid/</guid><description>I think the solo loot scenario is my favorite thing in Mists so far. And I don‚Äôt even mean the loot! The loot‚Äôs okay, but really, Elder Charms are SO Patch 5.1. I just love running the place! And finding hidden chests and secret paths to said chests. There‚Äôs been a few chests in the first room, and one in the hallway leading to the second room, that I have no idea at all how to reach.</description></item><item><title>Pretty Much a Constant Thing With Us</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/pretty-much-a-constant-thing-with-us/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2013 10:21:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/pretty-much-a-constant-thing-with-us/</guid><description>Hey, this feels familiar, doesn‚Äôt it?
Anyway, WE‚ÄôRE BACK! /blows kisses from amidst a sea of fluttering rose petals
The time off has been good to us and we‚Äôre ready to leap headfirst into all the exciting new 5.2 stuff! Let‚Äôs just hope we can remember how to do this comic thing! (Confession, it took me nearly 10 minutes to remember the WordPress login info.)
Now yes, we know that Heart of Fear is technically old content now, but we had this script in the queue and we can‚Äôt just WASTE it!</description></item><item><title>Sated</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/sated/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2013 10:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/sated/</guid><description>Whoa, whoa, where did 2013 come from? It totally snuck up and [Ambushed] us when we weren‚Äôt expecting it. We‚Äôve both been a little busy the last few days with RL travel, festivities and the ever pleasant-but-emotionally-draining family visits, but we‚Äôll be back on pace next week with new stuff!
Also, I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôve ever mentioned this, but we‚Äôre always open to ideas and suggestions! Many of our strips are inspired by actual conversations or experiences we‚Äôve had in-game, so if you come across something that you think we absolutely should know about, let us know in a comment, or tweet us at @fromdraenor!</description></item><item><title>Here We Come A-Wakening</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/here-we-come-a-wakening/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2012 11:08:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/here-we-come-a-wakening/</guid><description>It‚Äôs that time of year again! Perhaps you recognize the new and improved Greatfather Winter from last year‚Äôs escapades?
I love everything about this strip, but particularly tiny adorable Rades and Vid hanging off of Kovok there. Look for these as our Twitter avatars for a while!
(You may also be amused that an in-depth discussion about Klaxxi anatomical features and the specific societal roles of Klaxxi of different body types preceded the completion of this comic.</description></item><item><title>what</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/what/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/what/</guid><description>When Heart of Fear LFR came out, Garalon was‚Ä¶how shall we say‚Ä¶an interesting experience. And by interesting I mean painful, excruciating agony. It really became almost a joke that first week, to see how badly an LFR group would fail. And it‚Äôs not even necessarily people‚Äôs fault! Tag-team pass a kiting debuff back and forth with a stranger? And transmit it through touch? As in, the same mechanic that gave hardcore progression guilds migraines on Heroic Putricide back in ICC?</description></item><item><title>Surprisingly Often, Actually</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/surprisingly-often-actually/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2012 10:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/surprisingly-often-actually/</guid><description>From Draenor With Love launched November 1, 2011, which means it‚Äôs been an entire year! üòÄ I am pretty pleased that we put out a comic each and every week, even when life kicked us around a bit, or when one of us was traveling. Thanks to everyone who‚Äôs read our stuff over the past year! We appreciate your visits, your comments, your retweets, all of it!
Also, a special thanks to Dee, Ayms/Mits, and Walks, who gave us awesome guest strips!</description></item><item><title>Masks of Pandaria</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/masks-of-pandaria/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2012 19:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/masks-of-pandaria/</guid><description>AHHHH IT‚ÄôS HERE AT LAST
PET BATTLES
NEW QUESTS AND LORE AND STORIES
TRANSMOG GEAR
DUNGEONS
CHALLENGE MODES
MONKS
PANDAREN
Where do you even start??
I‚Äôm not going to even TRY to suggest what you should be doing, because it‚Äôs ALL amazing and beautiful and completely awesome. I‚Äôve been taking my time leveling, enjoying the scenery, the voice-acting, the unfolding story. It‚Äôs all so good! And I‚Äôm not even near level cap, or seeing the actual end-game content, or challenge modes, or the new battlegrounds.</description></item><item><title>Everything is New Again</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/everything-is-new-again/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2012 09:05:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/everything-is-new-again/</guid><description>Patch 5.0.4 is here and there‚Äôs so many exciting things to check out! Account-wide mounts! New talent systems! AoE looting! Revamped Scarlet Monastery, Scholomance and Ragefire Chasm! And there‚Äôs even apparently a new ferocious Darkmoon Rabbit world boss owning fools out at the Darkmoon Faire? I haven‚Äôt seen this fellow myself yet, but I‚Äôve heard the hilarious horror stories.
The world (of Warcraft) is suddenly a very new and thrilling place to be, and I love it.</description></item><item><title>Tides of War</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/tides-of-war/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/tides-of-war/</guid><description>Cross-faction friendships may be unorthodox, but they certainly aren‚Äôt unheard of. Jaina and Thrall have been friends since before he started calling himself Go‚Äôel. Asric and Jadaar are a pair of lesser-known but still significant ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù a blood elf and a draenei who seem to love to hate each other. Game mechanics prevent us from communicating with each other and they do an excellent job of keeping us divided. Ignorance breeds contempt and fear, and it‚Äôs easier to attack and kill an enemy that is strange and foreign to you.</description></item><item><title>Well Read</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/well-read/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2012 08:53:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/well-read/</guid><description>When we did the ‚ÄúRing of Lost‚Äù strip, a few different people were intrigued at the idea of Velen‚Äôs Book Club. So consider today‚Äôs comic a bit of a follow-up!
Actually, there‚Äôs almost enough readable books in WoW that you COULD have a book club! You‚Äôve got the Crawgol‚Äôs Silithid Field Guide (The Authoritotal Handbook)‚Ä¶the list goes on and on.
Personally, some of my favorite books are the ones that can be found during the Death Knight starter zone.</description></item><item><title>Glyph of Ireworks</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/glyph-of-ireworks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2012 09:06:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/glyph-of-ireworks/</guid><description>It may come as no surprise to you that I absolutely adore a good pun. And, I say with absolute shame pride that this is a true story, upon hearing of Mists‚Äô Glyph of Fireworks.
Judging from how people on Twitter reacted, I think Vid‚Äôs reaction in the last panel is one many people can relate with. What can I say? Those moments are just too funny. In fact, when my D&amp;amp;D group gets together to play, I have a private goal to produce at least one huge pun/groan moment each session.</description></item><item><title>There‚Äôs Something Different About You</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/theres-something-different-about-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 08:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/theres-something-different-about-you/</guid><description>Today‚Äôs comic is a special guest strip by our WONDERFUL and TALENTED friend Dee, who came through AMAZINGLY, considering she had only like half a day‚Äôs notice! You can check out her WoW blog at @mainfloortank!
(She really, really likes elves.)
THANKS DEE! You really helped us out. Much love!
Unfortunately, the reason Vid couldn‚Äôt finish this week‚Äôs strip was due to a sudden family emergency. Send some good thoughts and wishes her way, as she and her family could really use them.</description></item><item><title>The Lord of Terror</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-lord-of-terror/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2012 08:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-lord-of-terror/</guid><description>Like everyone else on the planet, we‚Äôve sunk some time into Diablo III so far, and it‚Äôs a blast. So far I‚Äôm greatly enjoying the Wizard (LASER FREEZE RAY) and the Demon Hunter is also a lot of fun. I‚Äôve played around with the Monk a bit, but I don‚Äôt think I enjoy the melee playstyle. I‚Äôll stick with my blasters.
Vid, of course, is playing a Wizard. Shocking, I know!</description></item><item><title>From Draenor with Mischief</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/from-draenor-with-mischief/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2012 09:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/from-draenor-with-mischief/</guid><description>This is the special prize strip Cymre of Bubbles of Mischief won by taking 1st place in the Great Blog Noblegarden Egg Hunt!
Congratulations Cymre! We hope you enjoy your guest appearance!
Cymre maintains an amazing gallery of World of Warcraft rare spawns on her blog ‚Äì aka, ‚ÄúSilver Dragons‚Äù ‚Äì so we thought, hey, what better way to celebrate her egg-hunting victory than with some Silver Dragon love of her own?</description></item><item><title>Our Unsung Hero</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-unsung-hero/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2012 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-unsung-hero/</guid><description>From Draenor presents, Real Azerothian Geniuses.
Today we salute you, Mr. Lamp Hum Sound Creator Guy.
You work tirelessly to capture the tranquil sound of a summer breeze or the frantic buzz of fireflies trapped in a jar, just to make our weary trek through the wild a little less scary.
In the darkest of nights, we pause on our journey, wondering if that subtle rustling we just heard was one of your masterpieces singing its peaceful song of illumination, or a horrible flesh-eating zombie lurking in the bushes.</description></item><item><title>Squeaky Green</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/squeaky-green/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2012 09:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/squeaky-green/</guid><description>When we heard that there would be no Blizzcon this year, Vid and I knew we had to cover it somehow. We ran down the list of Blizzcon cliches (true or not), one of which was the inevitable pungent result of cramming hundreds of bodies into a cramped, enclosed convention center.
Then, somehow, it became this.
To say Vid was mortified when I sent her the script would be an understatement.</description></item><item><title>Magic Touch</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/magic-touch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2012 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/magic-touch/</guid><description>‚Ä¶Then I finally found a suitable mold for the chassis or I thought it was a suitable chassis mold but actually they meant it for a gyrocopter and it wasn‚Äôt quite right so I tried to convince a friend to model for it but he wouldn‚Äôt because he said, and I quote, ‚ÄúYour inventions have a way of proving fatal to people who agree to test them,‚Äù I ask you, is that fair?</description></item><item><title>Damn You, Murglesnout</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/damn-you-murglesnout/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2012 09:21:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/damn-you-murglesnout/</guid><description>Oh, Murglesnout. Fisher‚Äôs bane. So plentiful. So abundant.
So utterly, completely worthless.
True, Blizzard did eventually add in a Cooking recipe so that the dreaded Murglesnout wasn‚Äôt COMPLETELY pointless. But it‚Äôs TOO LATE! Even now, the mere sight of THIS TERRIBLE FISH fills me with rage. MURGLESNOUT!
‚Ä¶however, it really does make a fun ‚Äúgift‚Äù to give friends.
If you want to MAKE THEM ANGRY!
MURGLESNOUT!</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Four</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-four/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2011 12:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-four/</guid><description>I wasn‚Äôt actually sure how Rades intended to end our little odyssey. Needless to say, my jaw dropped when I got this far in the script. It‚Äôs great for him, though, because he gets to show his mad genius! Vid, who has no compunction about blasting a rocket straight into Ironforge or any other environs, is a little uneasy when it comes to FrankenWinter. But ultimately, she decides that it‚Äôs better to let a cyborg version of Greatfather Winter do all of the Winter‚Äôs Veil stuff ‚Äì so that she and Rades don‚Äôt have to.</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Three</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-three/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2011 02:40:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-three/</guid><description>Part 3 of 4! Rades and Vid do their best to fill the late Greatfather Winter‚Äôs shoes ‚Äì in their own, unique fashion, of course.
Locations where Vid is now no longer permitted to operate: The Exodar AND Ironforge.
Hey, isn‚Äôt that rocket in panel 4 the same type as the one that blew up Greatfather Winter? Oh well, what those Druids don‚Äôt know, won‚Äôt hurt them‚Ä¶hopefully.
Next week‚Äôs Part 4 will come out a few days after Christmas, so consider it our special (belated) gift to you for reading!</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Two</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-two/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-two/</guid><description>The saga continues! Oh no, poor Greatfather Winter!
Vid did an awesome job with the expressions in this strip, I think you‚Äôll all agree. I‚Äôm now using the ‚ÄúSad Rades‚Äù face as my avatar, and I can‚Äôt even look at panel 3 without laughing.
There was some debate about which Greatfather Winter to use ‚Äì the dwarven Alliance version, or the orcish Horde version! In the end though, we decided to go with the dwarf, to include more races.</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part One</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2011 07:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-one/</guid><description>It‚Äôs a cliche often used that ‚Äúthe journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.‚Äù In this case, a journey of approximately 17,500 miles per hour begins with a single rocket and a large explosion.
This is how engineers work.
Rades and I wanted to do something a little special and different for the upcoming holiday season, as well as try our hands at a mini story-arc! So expect this story to run for pretty much the rest of the month, until we reach its epic conclusion.</description></item><item><title>Grudge Match</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/grudge-match/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/grudge-match/</guid><description>When the Pet Battle System was announced at Blizzcon, everyone had a wide range of reactions. Were they serious? Was this an elaborate joke? How much more like Pokemon could this possibly be? But without question, the most important possibility was the potential hilarity of absurd pet matchups, such as Alliance Balloon vs. Horde Balloon, or Enchanted Broom vs. Magic Lamp. Can you say EXCITEMENT??
Personally, I‚Äôm banking on my Toxic Wasteling.</description></item><item><title>Rare Spawn</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/rare-spawn-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2011 06:21:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/rare-spawn-3/</guid><description>I‚Äôm not especially good at keeping secrets. So the fact that you are only seeing this, now, after over a month of loving work is nothing short of a miracle. The idea of doing a webcomic wasn‚Äôt a new one for Rades and I ‚Äì we‚Äôd talked about it before, sometime last year ‚Äì but the time wasn‚Äôt right. We were on different pages about what a comic should be (I was thinking epic story, he was thinking gag) and so we just shelved it.</description></item></channel></rss>
