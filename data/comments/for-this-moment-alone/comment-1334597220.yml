comment: '<p>Moments where Miri goes “Oh shit” in raid:<br>1. Rebuilt UI, forgot to make sure Ultrax button was visible and got myself 1-shot<br>2. Forgot to modify that BoP macro for Madness and got myself 1-shot<br>3. Went Ret for H. Ultrax and didn’t have Power Auras working and got myself 1-shot<br>4. Fell off of Ultrax’s platform (actually, no, I haven’t done this one YET)</p><p>Usually when I say “oh shit” I’m about to die…it’s my warning to the healers &gt;.&gt;</p><p>(I was the fail button pusher in raid on Weds–to the point I just said, fuck this fight, I’m done for the week)</p>'
