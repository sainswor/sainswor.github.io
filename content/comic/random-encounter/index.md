It’s the scene from the <a href="/comic/chapter-two-doubt/">Chapter Title page</a>, oooooh! Sharp-eyed readers may notice something telling on that page now, too. But what does it mean?? Time will tell.


One of the most interesting things about writing FDWL is discussing scenes, and realizing how the events in the comic are letting us establish little character traits about Vid &amp; Rades. We had a good laugh when realizing what type of person Vid (the character) is when she’s on watch. What does she do when she hears a strange noise in the middle of the night? She doesn’t wake up Rades for backup, no – she grabs her mace and immediately charges headlong into battle.
