Stacey is the author of [Manalicious](https://manalicious.wordpress.com), a World of Warcraft blog about mages, guild leading, and heroic internet dragons. She is a freelance artist/illustrator who likes digital painting, making tiny Sculpey figurines, and drawing with Staedtler pigment liners (0.5, thanks!) She also enjoys writing, reading a wide variety of books, video games, and baking things for other people to eat. She lives with her husband Vosskah and a large silly chocolate Labrador Retriever named Rufus.

Mike wrote the World of Warcraft blog [Orcish Army Knife](https://orcisharmyknife.com). He loved delving into Warcraft lore, investigating intriguing but overlooked characters, and coming up with crazy predictions about future storylines. He was a journalist/graphic designer by trade, and loved the number 13, the color purple, and Transformers. He was also a wombat.
