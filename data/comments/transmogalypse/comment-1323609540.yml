comment: '<p>FWIW, I just re-transmogged into Judgement yesterday &gt;.&gt; Stupidly though, I did it with my Prot gear, which was supposed to be T6 and Judgement was going to be my healing gear &gt;&lt; I''ll re''mog again this week to correct that. It''s sorta funny how everyone in guild chips in to find weapons or other accessories that coordinate for each other when we''re having Transmog discussions…</p><p>And for what it''s worth, Sel only Transmogg''d his weapons–he''s having too much fun running around in his T13/T12H gear.. �?</p>'
