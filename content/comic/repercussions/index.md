Starting to get underway! The impact of Garrosh’s actions in the Vale. Major events are about to be set in motion.


Apologies for the disarray of the site design right now. We updated the WordPress version and it broke everything, just like it ALWAYS DOES (seriously, it actually breaks every time we update) but thankfully the damage doesn’t seem TOO severe this time. Hopefully it shouldn’t be too long before we get everything back to how it should be.


Maybe we’ll even get some kind of -gasp- ARCHIVE system up and running this time! MADNESS!!
