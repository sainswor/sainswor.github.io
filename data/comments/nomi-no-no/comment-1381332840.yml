comment: '<p>I love Nomi!  When my character is in less combat-focused situations I take out Nomi and Kekek (the Wolvar you adopt for Children’s Week, whom I named Kekek–and, yes, the Oracle I named Roo, too) and have them both follow me around (to Darkmoon Faire, etc.).  That way they each have a “brother” to play with, or so I imagine.  🙂</p>'
