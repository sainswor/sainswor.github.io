After all that time in Highmaul, I canâ€™t help but wonder about the ogres who, on OUR Draenor, ended up founding Ogriâ€™la. They were such an interesting faction! I guess it wouldnâ€™t really make sense to see them again in Warlords, since there is no area with such a prolific amount of Apexis crystals, the source of their increased intellect. At leastâ€¦not yet, anyway.


Many thanks to our latest patrons, William and Buglamp! In February, we met our wallpaper goal total, so there will be another bonus wallpaper for patrons later this month! ðŸ˜€
