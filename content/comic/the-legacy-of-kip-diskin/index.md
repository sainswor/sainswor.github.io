The new glyphs on the Mists of Pandaria beta sound *[amazing](http://mop.wowhead.com/search?q=date%3A2012-03-21#glyphs)*. Trust me, this is not the only glyph feature you’ll be seeing on From Draenor. 


I was actually surprised to see an Orca glyph, since they seem more suitable for Northrend than the lush, temperate zones of Pandaria. Wouldn’t it be funny if there were a huge assortment of minor glyphs that changed the appearance of druid travel and aquatic forms? Imagine the possibilities! Aquatic form: SQUID. Travel form: GIANT FERRET. Aquatic form: JELLYFISH.


Ah well. Maybe while they’re working on druid aesthetics, they can finally give troll druids the ability to perch. THEY CAN’T PERCH! How are their lives even worth living?!
