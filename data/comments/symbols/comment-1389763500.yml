comment: '<p>Begin Vid headcanon:<br>There’s a large, worn book somewhere in the library at Shattrath. They keep it not far from the census book, with the record of all missing/deceased persons (it’s a heavy book). But in THIS book all the symbols of every draenei family are inscribed. They’ve tried to keep track of the symbols whose lines have been snuffed out, but it’s difficult work and so it’s not very well done. They’re all recorded regardless. That’s why draenei don’t have family names – they have these instead.<br>/end Vid headcanon</p>'
