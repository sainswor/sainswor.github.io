comment: '<p>I’ll admit that his word choice is partially because of the relationship these two dragons have right now, which to me felt more appropriate as uncle/nephew than brothers.</p><p>It’s also a little unclear, though, if Deathwing actually WAS Wrathion’s father. Wrathion’s mother was the black dragon Nyxondra, but Sinestra is well-established in lore to be the only female black dragon to mate with Deathwing and survive the experience. </p><p>Personally, I think Wrathion doesn’t know who his father actually was, but likes to claim it was Deathwing for the sense of mystique and intimidation it provides.</p>'
