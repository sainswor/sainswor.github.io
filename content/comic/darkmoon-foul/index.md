Seriously, does no one else at the Faire raise an eyebrow at the fact that each month, Kerri Hicks is collecting *thousands of bloody ears?* I mean, the icon is an ear, and Blizzard has a tendency to encourage ear-collecting, ever since Diablo. What the heck is she DOING with all of these bloody trophies??


It seems such a disproportionate reward, too â€“ you bring back proof of 250(!) kills and you get 10 little tickets. You could play a handful of carnival games, or you could go out and kill HUNDREDS OF CREATURES. 


What a grim enterprise, Kerri Hicks. Grisly indeed.
