The funny thing about creating a weekly comic strip is that sometimes events take a little while to unfold. Though we’ve had this particular moment [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/fromdraenor;) supporters will forgive me for not showing the sketch for this page a day early as usual – I didn’t want to spoil the final version!


If you want to be further emotionally devastated today, [Unbroken](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/short-story/unbroken/1) is necessary reading. We used much of the physical description of the process of becoming Broken from this short story to help determine what our important character should look like.


Finally, in happier news, we concluded our [Twitter Argi giveaway](https://twitter.com/fromdraenor/status/540255877400260608) today! I love this little goat. She is the weirdest thing, but I knew as soon as I saw the images of her that we’d have to give one away to a FDWL reader.


That lucky reader is… [@KerynWeylan](https://twitter.com/KerynWeylan)! We’ll be in touch to help you get a space goat of your very own. Thanks to everyone who entered and followed us on Twitter.
