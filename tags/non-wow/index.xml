Rades is an accomplished engineer, he could undoubtedly keep a TARDIS running, and he could accomplish so much with a sonic screwdriver! I think Vid would make a great companion, though she could be the Doctor just as easily.
I did this art awhile ago and thought considering this Sunday‚Äôs announcement, using it now would be pretty timely. The opportunity to put Rades in a dapper suit jacket and bow tie was too good to pass up.</description></item><item><title>There Are Two Types of People</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/there-are-two-types-of-people/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2013 08:05:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/there-are-two-types-of-people/</guid><description>The most difficult thing about this comic is that I had to stop playing ‚ÄúAnimal Crossing: New Leaf‚Äù long enough to draw it.
If you‚Äôre not familiar, ACNL is a kind of life simulator game for the Nintendo 3DS that has been sweeping through the WoW twitter community like a wildfire. I played an earlier Animal Crossing title on the Gamecube back in the day.¬†In terms of gameplay it‚Äôs pretty basic: Grow/harvest fruit, plant flowers, laugh at things your neighbours say, fish and catch bugs, dig up fossils, design clothes.</description></item><item><title>Blizzcon Badges!</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/blizzcon-badges/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/blizzcon-badges/</guid><description>Do you need a little something to set you apart from the crowd at Blizzcon? Would you like a small piece of art to call your own and remember all the good times you had at the convention? I‚Äôve been painting up just the thing!
These little paintings are painted on thick, high-quality Arches watercolour paper with Winsor &amp;amp; Newton watercolours. In a world of art that‚Äôs increasingly digital, I find I am loving going back to my roots and painting with brushes and pigments again.</description></item><item><title>Desserter Debuff</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/desserter-debuff/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2013 08:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/desserter-debuff/</guid><description>At the end of March I was thrilled to be taking a trip to Toronto/Montr√©al because it meant I‚Äôd have the chance to meet lots of great WoW people I‚Äôd gotten to know online. When I looked for ‚ÄúThings To Do in Toronto‚Äù I found a listing for a cupcake decorating class, and that was just icing on the cake. I was thrilled when Serrinne, Kaleri and Jasyla agreed to go with me.</description></item><item><title>Rested Experience</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/rested-experience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2013 11:55:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/rested-experience/</guid><description>Well, it finally happened: Vid‚Äôs drawing arm fell off. Like, literally, just sketching away and plop! it‚Äôs a scene right out of the Undercity. It‚Äôs all good though, she‚Äôs out talking to Mekkatorque right now about a steam-powered mechanical replacement. She says it‚Äôs no big deal, but as a veteran engineer, I remain skeptical.
But joking aside, the unfortunate reality is we‚Äôre starting to feel a bit of burnout, and there‚Äôs been some real-life commitments that are rearing their unavoidable and time-consuming heads.</description></item><item><title>Sated</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/sated/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2013 10:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/sated/</guid><description>Whoa, whoa, where did 2013 come from? It totally snuck up and [Ambushed] us when we weren‚Äôt expecting it. We‚Äôve both been a little busy the last few days with RL travel, festivities and the ever pleasant-but-emotionally-draining family visits, but we‚Äôll be back on pace next week with new stuff!
Also, I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôve ever mentioned this, but we‚Äôre always open to ideas and suggestions! Many of our strips are inspired by actual conversations or experiences we‚Äôve had in-game, so if you come across something that you think we absolutely should know about, let us know in a comment, or tweet us at @fromdraenor!</description></item><item><title>Unique-Equipped</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/unique-equipped/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 09:17:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/unique-equipped/</guid><description>It really was at Velen‚Äôs Book Club.
If you‚Äôve been reading FDWL regularly since around May, you might remember this comic about Millya‚Äôs lost tail ring. Inspired by an unfortunate true story, it was around that time that I realized I had lost my wedding rings. We looked everywhere for them, upended everything, and ultimately concluded that they were lost forever. (A process that involved no small amount of hand-wringing and angst, I‚Äôll admit).</description></item><item><title>WTB Real-life Alter Time</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/wtb-real-life-alter-time/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2012 09:42:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/wtb-real-life-alter-time/</guid><description>Please accept this pseudo-comic along with my apologies for this week. Last Friday we went to a concert! It was great and we had a great time. But the guy sitting next to Voss was coughing the entire time almost nonstop.
Voss told me darkly as we left, ‚ÄúI sure hope I didn‚Äôt catch germs from whatever was making that guy cough up his lung.‚Äù
Unfortunately, we both did. I‚Äôll spare you the gory details except to say that I can‚Äôt remember having a cold that floored me like this one, ever.</description></item><item><title>Ring of Lost</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/ring-of-lost/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2012 08:53:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/ring-of-lost/</guid><description>Ever wonder if WoW characters have the same day-to-day problems that plague us in real life? In this case, Vid had a minor crisis this week regarding a lost wedding ring, which sounds a lot like a quest, only there‚Äôs no handy directional guide in real life, and no reward other than a tremendous sense of relief.
Anyway, we thought that, you know, for the amount of travel and continent-hopping the average WoW hero does, remembering where you put something down must be a tremendous hassle.</description></item><item><title>The Lord of Terror</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-lord-of-terror/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2012 08:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-lord-of-terror/</guid><description>Like everyone else on the planet, we‚Äôve sunk some time into Diablo III so far, and it‚Äôs a blast. So far I‚Äôm greatly enjoying the Wizard (LASER FREEZE RAY) and the Demon Hunter is also a lot of fun. I‚Äôve played around with the Monk a bit, but I don‚Äôt think I enjoy the melee playstyle. I‚Äôll stick with my blasters.
Vid, of course, is playing a Wizard. Shocking, I know!</description></item><item><title>Our Poor, Tired Feet</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-poor-tired-feet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2012 05:19:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-poor-tired-feet/</guid><description>The Calgary Expo was on the weekend, and, well, it was an‚Ä¶interesting experience.
There was waiting. There were photos with Patrick Stewart and autographs from Wil Wheaton. There was more waiting. There was the chance to meet Fyreuni of Daily Quests.
Oh, and there was a near-riot when the Expo shut the doors because they had oversold and weren‚Äôt letting in any more attendees, regardless of pre-purchased tickets, ‚Äúwe have a scheduled photoshoot with Patrick Stewart‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI just stepped outside for a smoke and my family is still inside!</description></item><item><title>Choose Wisely</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/choose-wisely/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2012 09:43:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/choose-wisely/</guid><description>Yes, we know Droids and Hutts are not actually available player races in SWTOR. Too bad ‚Äì I would totally be a Hutt so I could use awful HUTT YOUR MOUTH and HUTT UP puns and make everyone hate me.
Also, I wish I could say we were joking when talking about Vid‚Äôs overpowering love for anyone blue. Let‚Äôs just say that panel 4 isn‚Äôt entirely off the mark. üòâ</description></item><item><title>For Science, You Monster</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/for-science-you-monster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/for-science-you-monster/</guid><description>Hey guys, Vid‚Äôs been crit by real life this week, so send her warm thoughts because until she‚Äôs back, you‚Äôre stuck with my terrible WoW Model Viewer comics!
Last night Blizzard released an updated Mists of Pandaria talent calculator, complete with new baseline talents. One of the new baseline Warlock talents was Demonic Portal, as pictured above. Needless to say, the Portal comparisons were instant and furious! So I figured it was an appropriate time to break out ye old Undercity Companion Cube image from this year‚Äôs Love is in the Air seasonal event.</description></item></channel></rss>
