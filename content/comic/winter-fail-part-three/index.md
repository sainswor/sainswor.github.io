Part 3 of 4! Rades and Vid do their best to fill the late Greatfather Winter’s shoes – in their own, unique fashion, of course.


Locations where Vid is now no longer permitted to operate: The Exodar AND Ironforge.


Hey, isn’t that rocket in panel 4 the same type as the one that blew up Greatfather Winter? Oh well, what those Druids don’t know, won’t hurt them…hopefully.


Next week’s Part 4 will come out a few days after Christmas, so consider it our special (belated) gift to you for reading!
