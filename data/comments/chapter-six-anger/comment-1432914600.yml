comment: '<p>5 Hours sunk into trying to play a platformer in the middle of the MMO to get to treasures and other trinkets on my map only to get frustrated and leave it until later when they lifted the no flying like they had every expac before hand.</p><p>I mean, I’m not saying otherwise, I suck at trying to just perfectly nail that one pixel to hit the rope off the tree and jump the birds without falling to go back to spending another 4 minutes just trying to get on the tree to hit the rope again MAYBE, and it was really disheartening.</p><p>And I’ll never get those boxes, cause I’ll never get to fly, and that’s okay. I just really would’ve liked to fly and see all that beauty from above, and get those shiny treasure boxes I lack the hand-eye-coordination to get as is xD</p>'
