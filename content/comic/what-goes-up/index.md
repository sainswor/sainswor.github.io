Poor Four. Brawler’s Guild just couldn’t really prepare her for what to do when hitchhiking on the back of an unwilling flying black dragon, I guess.


Now, if only she were an engineer, she’d be fine here! A parachute cloak, or a goblin glider, and she’d be laughing.


Sadly, Four is not an engineer.
