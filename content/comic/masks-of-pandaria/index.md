Where do you even start??


Iâ€™m not going to even TRY to suggest what you should be doing, because itâ€™s ALL amazing and beautiful and completely awesome. Iâ€™ve been taking my time leveling, enjoying the scenery, the voice-acting, the unfolding story. Itâ€™s all so good! And Iâ€™m not even near level cap, or seeing the actual end-game content, or challenge modes, or the new battlegrounds. And I havenâ€™t rolled a Pandaren yet, either! Though I do have a name reserved for him which I look forward to having a lot of fun with: BACON.


Ahhhh, itâ€™s almost overwhelming!


Oh, and hey, how about that problem-free launch? Iâ€™m sure there were some minor snags here or there, but nothing compared to the train wreck that was Diablo IIIâ€™s launch. So hats off to you, Blizz! This is shaping up to be an incredible expansion. I havenâ€™t been this excited about the game in ages. ðŸ˜€
