comment: '<p>Never really read many of the novels, but in game after Jaina expels the Sunreavers from Dalaran, Varian makes a remark to the tune of ‘Well, it is good to see her actually doing something for a change.’ (I doubt I quoted him verbatim, but it’s along those lines. I was a little surprised at the audacity.)</p>'
