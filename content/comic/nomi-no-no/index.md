As many Pandaria chefs know, [achievement](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=7325).


However, to become Best Friends you have to go through a ton of cooking dailies with Nomi, where you give him some mundane cooking ingredients each day so he can practice his culinary skills. He then gives you back some [Fish Jerky](https://www.wowhead.com/item=81402) or some other junk.


Most people just sell the stuff to a vendor. But me? I don’t want his crappy food.<br>
***SO I DESTROY IT.*** Usually right after he’s handed it to me, and is still standing two feet away.


What?


THIS IS WHAT I THINK OF YOUR STUPID PEACHES


I’m not walking over to some vendor just for a few silver! My bag space and my time are too valuable to spent on your amateur-hour meals, kid.


(In other words, it’s pretty much this:)
