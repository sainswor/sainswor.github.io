Wrathion‚Äôs got some thinking to do.
With that, think it‚Äôs about time for a change of scenery. Let‚Äôs get out of the mountains, and pay a visit to‚Ä¶oh, how about‚Ä¶the forest.
Finally, thank you to our latest Patreon supporter, Allison! üòÄ</description></item><item><title>True Colors</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/true-colors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2015 09:58:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/true-colors/</guid><description>I just noticed this week that the Sargerei mobs in Shadowmoon Valley (and the Sargerei Disguise toy) use a recolor of Sablemane‚Äôs outfit! The green and purple look‚Äôs not bad, but it doesn‚Äôt quite have the zing of Sablemane‚Äôs bright orange and red, in my opinion.</description></item><item><title>Trump Card</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/trump-card/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2015 10:02:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/trump-card/</guid><description>Sablemane may just come to regret antagonizing Wrathion so much.
Oh, and in case you‚Äôre curious when Wrathion may have picked up one of those Ethereal spheres‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs an unfortunate reality that this type of conversation isn‚Äôt exactly that uncommon between parent and child. In a perfect world, parents would be accepting of the choices their children make, regardless of whether or not they agree with them. But we all know that doesn‚Äôt always happen.</description></item><item><title>Irreconcilable Differences</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/irreconcilable-differences/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 09:46:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/irreconcilable-differences/</guid><description>ÔøΩ?
In brighter news, Blizzard Watch has brought back its WoW webcomic link list! It‚Äôs called Webcomic Wrapup now ‚Äì if you want some more Warcraft (or related) webcomics in your life ‚Äì and why wouldn‚Äôt you! ‚Äì go check the list!</description></item><item><title>Ties</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/ties/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2015 09:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/ties/</guid><description>I imagine if any of us were in Vid‚Äôs shoes, deprived of our mounts, we‚Äôd find it a harsh awakening. I mean, going without flying mounts in Warlords has been tough enough!
The 6.2 PTR just went live this week! Don‚Äôt worry, no spoilers here, but I will just say we‚Äôre pretty keenly interested to see how some of the datamined stuff turns out! FDWL obviously takes place on the original Outlands version of Draenor‚Ä¶but that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre not paying close attention to the lore and history being established in-game!</description></item><item><title>Interlude</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/interlude/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2015 09:43:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/interlude/</guid><description>LOOK AT THE CUTE BIRBS

I liked it because of Tong ‚Äì how he finally has had enough and steps in and reprimands Wrathion for his childish behavior. Or to be precise, I enjoyed it because this NEVER HAPPENS.</description></item><item><title>Family Business, Part Two</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/family-business-part-two/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2015 09:40:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/family-business-part-two/</guid><description>Alternate title for today‚Äôs page: WRONGO</description></item><item><title>Family Business, Part One</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/family-business-part-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 09:59:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/family-business-part-one/</guid><description>Sablemane‚Äôs been chilling in Blade‚Äôs Edge for a while, but he‚Äôs still got contacts, visitors passing through.

They were such an interesting faction! I guess it wouldn‚Äôt really make sense to see them again in Warlords, since there is no area with such a prolific amount of Apexis crystals, the source of their increased intellect. At least‚Ä¶not yet, anyway.
Many thanks to our latest patrons, William and Buglamp!</description></item><item><title>Focus</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/focus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2015 09:43:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/focus/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Glyph of Harsh Words</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/glyph-of-harsh-words/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2015 09:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/glyph-of-harsh-words/</guid><description>Erm, um, maybe that‚Äôs enough of Vid for now‚Ä¶let‚Äôs check in on someone else next week, shall we?

Blackrock Foundry is live! Is your guild all set to take down Blackhand? I can‚Äôt wait to see what sort of interesting mechanics Blizzard throws at us this time. And it‚Äôs always exciting when you start collecting the first new tier set of an expansion!

Wrathion seems to think he‚Äôs eliminated the rest of the Black Dragonflight‚Ä¶but we know he‚Äôs missed at least one.
When we were planning out the FDWL storyline, Wrathion meeting Sablemane was one of our major plot points. And I‚Äôve had the above image in my head ever since, of a totally out-of-his-element Wrathion in Blade‚Äôs Edge, gazing up in frozen shock at those iconic stone spires and impaled black dragons overhead.</description></item></channel></rss>
