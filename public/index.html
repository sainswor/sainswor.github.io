<p>I&rsquo;m working on this as a tribute to Rades. I miss him a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the basic plumbing worked out for everything except the calendar and the comments. I&rsquo;m hoping to get those sorted out soon. The goal is to eventually have a faithful recreation of the original site (well, except that there&rsquo;s going to be a link to Hugo instead of Wordpress in the bottom corner), meaning eventually, instead of a note on what I&rsquo;ve been working on, this will be the final page of the comic (the fourth page of the epilogue).</p>
<p>As of now, though, you&rsquo;re probably best off just going to <a href="./comic/rare-spawn-3">the start of the comic</a>.</p>
