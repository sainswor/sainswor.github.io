comment: '<p>Pretty sure you’re the only person here labeling Kael’s behavior as a homosexual stereotype.</p><p>I’m labeling it the stereotypical behavior of an immature straight man who feels entitled to women’s attention by virtue of his existence and can’t handle the idea that women are people who are allowed to make their own choices – which include rejecting potential romantic partners for pretty much any reason they please. Which includes “I’m not attracted to you.” Which Jaina wasn’t, and the Arthas book makes it clear why: he was literally hundreds of years older than her, he was not her peer in terms of political power or influence, and she found him impossible to relax around. Jaina could not relate to Kael’thas. Kael’s poor handling of his rejection only really proves that she made the right choice in rejecting him.</p><p>It’s really interesting to me that you seem to read Kael’thas’ acting like a child about being rejected romantically as an undermining of his narrative positioning as a straight man. The only thing his behavior undermines is his maturity. Pretty sure immature behavior is not limited to any single sexuality, and the fact that you associate it with homosexuality says more about your perceptions than it does about Golden’s writing.</p><p>Here’s the thing: you’re right that the fan base behaves in really homophobic ways toward blood elves in general. That isn’t actually Golden or Blizzard’s fault. That’s the fault of individuals who have internalized the idea that straight men can’t be vain about their appearance, or wear their hair long, or be concerned with the decoration of their space, or whatever. That fan attitude says A LOT about how the rest of us apply labels to human behaviors. As Rades says, none of these behaviors are intrinsic to a sexuality. The only behaviors that indicate sexuality are sexual behaviors, and even then it’s muddled and fluid (know anyone who was, say, in a straight marriage for years only to realize they were gay? yeah, it happens.) For the record: Blizzard does fan the flames of this perception in a way I find extremely distasteful, unfortunately.</p><p>But ultimately, here’s the thing: by deciding that Kael’s emotional behaviors clearly code him as gay, you’re the one being gender essentialist by denying that men of all sexualities are capable of displaying the full range of [human] behaviors. Think about it.</p>'
