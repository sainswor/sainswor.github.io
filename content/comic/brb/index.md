I think Wrathion is my favorite character to write, especially because itâ€™s so easy to imagine his voice saying the lines, since we heard him so much during *Mists of Pandaria*. Of course, it helps that his voice actor Aaron Phillips does hilarious things like read out [fake Guy Fieri menus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJidgg0TfU8).
