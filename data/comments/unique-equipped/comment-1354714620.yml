comment: '<p>Thanks! I’m not sure yet what I’ll do. The originals are currently with the goldsmith for sizing, when I get them back I may alternate them, or possibly wear the new one on my right hand. I’ll have to see if that would look silly or not. Fortunately it fits both hands, more or less! I was trying it on the right hand yesterday until Voss got upset and was like “PUT IT ON THE PROPER FINGER.” He’s funny. ;p</p>'
