That wraps up Chapter Four! What does Sablemane want with Wrathion? What’s going to happen to Rades? What happened to Four? At least Vid’s received some happy news…


Speaking of Wrathion, I sure am curious what we’ll see of him in Warlords. I believe his only appearance so far takes place “off-camera”, mentioned in [Admiral Taylor’s Garrison Log](http://www.wowhead.com/item=119348/admiral-taylors-garrison-log), which doesn’t really tell us much. Clearly the Black Prince has SOMETHING in mind, SOME objective here on AU-Draenor. And if you didn’t read War Crimes, you may also be unaware that Wrathion had a role in Garrosh’s escape. Is he still pursuing his objective of forcing the Horde and Alliance to band together against a common foe? Or does he have something else in mind?
