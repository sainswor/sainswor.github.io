It’s like [that Feist song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYF0qU5WSew)


It’s Blizzcon time! Last time Vid and I were stunned with the announcement that WoW was returning to Draenor – one might say “with love” – so it’ll be interesting to see what the big news and surprises are this time! It’s funny – when the news about Warlords of Draenor hit, we were actually a little alarmed, wondering if it was going to affect FDWL’s storyline. Of course, since this is an alternate Draenor, everything turned out fine. Actually, better than fine, because we’ve been able to benefit from the new Draenor lore that Blizzard has created for the expansion! 


Now, if they announce a new expansion with playable male and female ogres…


If you’re headed to Anaheim, we hope you have a good time! We actually will have a few friends handing out some FDWL stickers, so keep your eye out! In fact, feel free to tweet/email us a picture of you with your stickers – we’d love to see them!
