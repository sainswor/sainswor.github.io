Please accept this pseudo-comic along with my apologies for this week. Last Friday we went to a concert! It was great and we had a great time. But the guy sitting next to Voss was coughing the entire time almost nonstop.


Voss told me darkly as we left, “I sure hope I didn’t catch germs from whatever was making that guy cough up his lung.”


Unfortunately, we both did. I’ll spare you the gory details except to say that I can’t remember having a cold that floored me like this one, ever. It’s been over a week and I’m still not back to 100%. I muddled through to put this up and it came at a good time as Rades is having computer troubles – so normal comics resume next week when hopefully everything will be in tip-top shape again! I hope you’re all enjoying the new 5.1 content!
