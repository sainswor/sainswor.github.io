Everyone’s been buzzing about the new &amp; improved [Scroll of Resurrection](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/services/scroll-of-resurrection/), and why not? A free level 80, realm transfer AND faction transfer? Just for coming back to the game? Yeah, it’s no wonder the new Scroll offer has been so popular.


Of course, we all know what’s REALLY behind the Scroll frenzy. 


***SPECTRAL MOUNTS***.


Awww yeah. That’s the kind of incentive that gets RESULTS.


PS: Did you know Stormwind really does have a War Room? Seriously, it’s right next to Varian’s throne room. Go take a look.
