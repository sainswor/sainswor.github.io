comment: '<p>What’s wishy-washy about her? It seems like every time she stands up for herself and what she believes someone wants to smack her down for it (whether it’s actual other characters or dudebros reading about her). Then when she shows emotion/caring she gets mocked for it.</p><p>I realize you’re trying to be ‘humorous’ or ‘ironic’ but sometimes the line seems to blur between that and things said in seriousness. (And I’ve seen all of the above said in complete seriousness.) So I’m having a hard time figuring out what you’re saying in jest and what you aren’t, to support that ‘wishy-washy’ bit. :-/</p><p>I’ve just noticed over the years of playing that I can learn a *lot* about another WoW player by how they view Jaina (and why), sadly.</p>'
