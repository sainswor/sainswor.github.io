Somewhere out there in Pandaria, there’s an armorsmith [with one twisted sense of humor.](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/3DOU3Y2R8EL31361843411675.jpg)


Poor clueless little Anduin. Hands up if you saw him step onto that platform covered in Sha magic and walk right up to Garrosh, and thought to yourself “welp, I have a bad feeling about how this is going to turn out.” AND SURE ENOUGH. 


Should have listened to Dezco, kid. Even if he does wear babies as armor.
