The mental images of Healing Rain, Hurricane or Fan of Knives duplicating over and over again are too funny.
In the end, we decided to go with a theme preferred by Vid: CAKES (you can never have too much cake, according to her) and dead Warlocks. Also, the opportunity to have a sea of cakes was too great to pass up.</description></item><item><title>Yellow Angry Man</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/yellow-angry-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/yellow-angry-man/</guid><description>If you’ve played a paladin at level 85 for any length of time, hopefully this requires no explanation. For those of you who haven’t, well. Perhaps you play a melee DPS. You’re at the boss’ feet, stabbing/slicing/cutting (or whatever else it is that you melee folks do).
You hear an odd grunt.
“ARRRRGH!”
“GRRRRRR!”
“RRRRRAAA!”
This, my friends, is the Yellow, Angry Man. His anger knows no bounds. Likewise, his yellow-ness is unsurpassed.</description></item></channel></rss>
