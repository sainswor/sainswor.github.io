HEY MURADIN [PUT A BIRD ON IT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHmLljk2t8M)


Like we said last week…Warrior glyphs in Mists = THE COOLEST.


Some news about the next few weeks! This weekend, we’ll be attending a Comic Expo in Calgary! Excitement! Our strip next week will be something based off the Expo, we hope. Then, the week after that we plan on presenting the special guest strip for [Great Blog Noblegarden Egg Hunt](http://kamaliaetalia.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/the-great-blog-noblegarden-egg-hunt-3-0-concluded/)! So keep your eyes peeled!


…I can’t stop laughing at Muradin’s face in the last panel, guys. 


SERIOUSLY JUST LOOK AT IT
