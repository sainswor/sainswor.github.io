comment: '<p>I took my frost mage (now the proud wielder of Ebonchill) to Stormheim and started killing plenty of storm dragons and vrykul. I am two thirds of the way through the trials and happy that it was a smooth launch. Tonight, I took a few more of my characters (monk, paladin, and shaman) through the artifact quest chains. My favorite (other than the aforementioned frost mage) was probably the elemental shaman, but I canâ€™t say much for their order hall.</p>'
