When we did the “<a href="/comic/ring-of-lost">Ring of Lost</a>” strip, a few different people were intrigued at the idea of Velen’s Book Club. So consider today’s comic a bit of a follow-up!


Actually, there’s almost enough readable books in WoW that you COULD have a book club! You’ve got the [Crawgol’s Silithid Field Guide (The Authoritotal Handbook)](http://www.wowhead.com/item=50162/crawgols-silithid-field-guide)…the list goes on and on.


Personally, some of my favorite books are the ones that can be found during the Death Knight starter zone. I highly recommend taking a few moments and reading the [Corpulous’ Mess Hall Rules](http://www.wowhead.com/object=191646). They’re full of great life tips that any would-be adventurer should always be sure to remember. For example: “No eat self.”


Sage advice.
