I imagine if any of us were in Vidâ€™s shoes, deprived of our mounts, weâ€™d find it a harsh awakening. I mean, going without flying mounts in Warlords has been tough enough!


The 6.2 PTR just went live this week! Donâ€™t worry, no spoilers here, but I will just say weâ€™re pretty keenly interested to see how some of the datamined stuff turns out! FDWL obviously takes place on the original Outlands version of Draenorâ€¦but that doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™re not paying close attention to the lore and history being established in-game!


Finally, thank you to our latest Patron, Corath! ðŸ˜€
