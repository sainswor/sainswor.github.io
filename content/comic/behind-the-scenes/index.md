Because this Monday was my birthday and I was going out of town on the weekend, I asked Rades if we could take a week off the “regular” comic! We agreed to do it and just have something for filler. I thought that especially since I now do most of the comic on paper that it might be interesting for you to see where I do it and what it looks like from my end.


I hope that the hand-drawn quality comes through on the comics. As mentioned briefly above, I wanted really variable line width and a lot of control over the “feel” of the drawings and the best way I have found to do that is a really fine brush and acrylic artist’s ink. It has its own quirks and peculiarities, too, like that it unfortunately starts drying out usually halfway through inking a page. It gets pretty thick and sludgy, at which point I have to get some fresh ink and clean my brush. I could use a thinner ink but the blacks don’t scan very black. Same thing with most pens. So we moved from being very high tech (100% digital for the first few years of the comic) to somewhat archaic as I measure out the boxes and draw with a pencil. The end result is something I’m proud of, though, and I’m happy we made this change.


As you can probably tell from the different pictures, my studio wasn’t exactly *pristine* lately. If you want to see more before and afters, I posted some on [my Tumblr](http://vidyala.tumblr.com/post/76682404715/my-studio-unfucking-i-lost-track-of-how-many) back when I was doing The Great Clean. It turns out I can work much better in a clean environment anyhow. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have that the pictures don’t make clear!
