comment: '<p>Actually, one thing which does drive me nuts (but I know, it’s the way the game works) is that when in Outland, everything is basically… set before the end of the Burning Crusade.  (Ditto Northrend and Lich King.)  This makes me worry a bit that in Orgrimmar, Garrosh will still be there enthroned from now on (I really, really hope not!) despite his defeat in Siege in Orgrimmar.  Quite curious about how the “back in time” aspect of Warlords of Draenor will affect–or (probably, I assume) not affect–Outland as Outland, as in theory one could go do a few dailies in Outland and then pop back to Old Draenor, and Lord knows how causality will or won’t be involved.  (Perhaps it just spins off a new universe in which Krypton didn’t explode, er, I mean, Draenor didn’t become Outland?)</p>'
