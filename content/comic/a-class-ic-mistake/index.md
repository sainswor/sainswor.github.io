We don’t use colour in our pages that often, but man, when we do, it’s sure a nice contrast with the black &amp; white panels!


I don’t know about you, but I would *totally* craft a hot pink Sky Golem in-game and fly around in it. 


This week’s page is actually canonical – it’s Vid’s birthday next week! The real Vid, I mean! So be sure to wish her well. To celebrate, she’s going out of town, so there won’t be an actual comic page next week. We’ll still have something new for you, though.


Also, be sure to check [Vid’s blog](http://manalicious.wordpress.com/) later today for a little extra behind-the-scenes fun about this week’s page!
