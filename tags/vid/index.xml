I’m totally pumped, but I’m also dreading it! I want to see the cool new raid content and bosses, but I don’t WANT to kill Nazgrim! I don’t WANT to kill the Paragons!
And I don’t want to kill Garrosh!
(He’s a major From Draenor With Love character, after all!)
Speaking of the comic, this strip marks an important milestone for us. Starting next week, everything is changing!</description></item><item><title>The Real Twelve</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-real-twelve/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2013 09:02:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-real-twelve/</guid><description>Hey, I don’t think it’s too much of a stretch! Rades is an accomplished engineer, he could undoubtedly keep a TARDIS running, and he could accomplish so much with a sonic screwdriver! I think Vid would make a great companion, though she could be the Doctor just as easily.
I did this art awhile ago and thought considering this Sunday’s announcement, using it now would be pretty timely. The opportunity to put Rades in a dapper suit jacket and bow tie was too good to pass up.</description></item><item><title>There Are Two Types of People</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/there-are-two-types-of-people/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2013 08:05:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/there-are-two-types-of-people/</guid><description>The most difficult thing about this comic is that I had to stop playing “Animal Crossing: New Leaf” long enough to draw it.
If you’re not familiar, ACNL is a kind of life simulator game for the Nintendo 3DS that has been sweeping through the WoW twitter community like a wildfire. I played an earlier Animal Crossing title on the Gamecube back in the day. In terms of gameplay it’s pretty basic: Grow/harvest fruit, plant flowers, laugh at things your neighbours say, fish and catch bugs, dig up fossils, design clothes.</description></item><item><title>A Quick AFK</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/a-quick-afk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2013 18:24:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/a-quick-afk/</guid><description>This week in lieu of a comic we have instead a quick painting I did. I’ve had family stuff come up that I had to deal with, it’s sad but sometimes life wins out. The average comic takes me around five+ hours to draw and unfortunately this week I didn’t have those hours. Back when we started FDWL they used to take me eight! I haven’t gotten that much faster, I have simplified the art significantly though.</description></item><item><title>Our New Favorite Boss</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-new-favorite-boss/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2013 07:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-new-favorite-boss/</guid><description>Could this really be that far off, after seeing Tortos?
There’s been a lot of interesting raid boss mechanics – vehicles, flying, spirit realms – but few things are as satisfying or funny as just hauling off and punting a giant turtle at an even BIGGER turtle.
Bravo, Blizzard encounter design team. Bravo.</description></item><item><title>Fortune and Glory, Kid</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/fortune-and-glory-kid/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2013 08:37:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/fortune-and-glory-kid/</guid><description>I think the solo loot scenario is my favorite thing in Mists so far. And I don’t even mean the loot! The loot’s okay, but really, Elder Charms are SO Patch 5.1. I just love running the place! And finding hidden chests and secret paths to said chests. There’s been a few chests in the first room, and one in the hallway leading to the second room, that I have no idea at all how to reach.</description></item><item><title>Sated</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/sated/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2013 10:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/sated/</guid><description>Whoa, whoa, where did 2013 come from? It totally snuck up and [Ambushed] us when we weren’t expecting it. We’ve both been a little busy the last few days with RL travel, festivities and the ever pleasant-but-emotionally-draining family visits, but we’ll be back on pace next week with new stuff!
Also, I don’t know if we’ve ever mentioned this, but we’re always open to ideas and suggestions! Many of our strips are inspired by actual conversations or experiences we’ve had in-game, so if you come across something that you think we absolutely should know about, let us know in a comment, or tweet us at @fromdraenor!</description></item><item><title>Here We Come A-Wakening</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/here-we-come-a-wakening/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2012 11:08:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/here-we-come-a-wakening/</guid><description>It’s that time of year again! Perhaps you recognize the new and improved Greatfather Winter from last year’s escapades?
I love everything about this strip, but particularly tiny adorable Rades and Vid hanging off of Kovok there. Look for these as our Twitter avatars for a while!
(You may also be amused that an in-depth discussion about Klaxxi anatomical features and the specific societal roles of Klaxxi of different body types preceded the completion of this comic.</description></item><item><title>Surprisingly Often, Actually</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/surprisingly-often-actually/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2012 10:44:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/surprisingly-often-actually/</guid><description>From Draenor With Love launched November 1, 2011, which means it’s been an entire year! 😀 I am pretty pleased that we put out a comic each and every week, even when life kicked us around a bit, or when one of us was traveling. Thanks to everyone who’s read our stuff over the past year! We appreciate your visits, your comments, your retweets, all of it!
Also, a special thanks to Dee, Ayms/Mits, and Walks, who gave us awesome guest strips!</description></item><item><title>Masks of Pandaria</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/masks-of-pandaria/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2012 19:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/masks-of-pandaria/</guid><description>AHHHH IT’S HERE AT LAST
PET BATTLES
NEW QUESTS AND LORE AND STORIES
TRANSMOG GEAR
DUNGEONS
CHALLENGE MODES
MONKS
PANDAREN
Where do you even start??
I’m not going to even TRY to suggest what you should be doing, because it’s ALL amazing and beautiful and completely awesome. I’ve been taking my time leveling, enjoying the scenery, the voice-acting, the unfolding story. It’s all so good! And I’m not even near level cap, or seeing the actual end-game content, or challenge modes, or the new battlegrounds.</description></item><item><title>Tides of War</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/tides-of-war/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/tides-of-war/</guid><description>Cross-faction friendships may be unorthodox, but they certainly aren’t unheard of. Jaina and Thrall have been friends since before he started calling himself Go’el. Asric and Jadaar are a pair of lesser-known but still significant “friends,” a blood elf and a draenei who seem to love to hate each other. Game mechanics prevent us from communicating with each other and they do an excellent job of keeping us divided. Ignorance breeds contempt and fear, and it’s easier to attack and kill an enemy that is strange and foreign to you.</description></item><item><title>Glyph of Ireworks</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/glyph-of-ireworks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2012 09:06:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/glyph-of-ireworks/</guid><description>It may come as no surprise to you that I absolutely adore a good pun. And, I say with absolute shame pride that this is a true story, upon hearing of Mists’ Glyph of Fireworks.
Judging from how people on Twitter reacted, I think Vid’s reaction in the last panel is one many people can relate with. What can I say? Those moments are just too funny. In fact, when my D&amp;amp;D group gets together to play, I have a private goal to produce at least one huge pun/groan moment each session.</description></item><item><title>There’s Something Different About You</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/theres-something-different-about-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 08:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/theres-something-different-about-you/</guid><description>Today’s comic is a special guest strip by our WONDERFUL and TALENTED friend Dee, who came through AMAZINGLY, considering she had only like half a day’s notice! You can check out her WoW blog at @mainfloortank!
(She really, really likes elves.)
THANKS DEE! You really helped us out. Much love!
Unfortunately, the reason Vid couldn’t finish this week’s strip was due to a sudden family emergency. Send some good thoughts and wishes her way, as she and her family could really use them.</description></item><item><title>The Lord of Terror</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-lord-of-terror/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2012 08:32:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/the-lord-of-terror/</guid><description>Like everyone else on the planet, we’ve sunk some time into Diablo III so far, and it’s a blast. So far I’m greatly enjoying the Wizard (LASER FREEZE RAY) and the Demon Hunter is also a lot of fun. I’ve played around with the Monk a bit, but I don’t think I enjoy the melee playstyle. I’ll stick with my blasters.
Vid, of course, is playing a Wizard. Shocking, I know!</description></item><item><title>From Draenor with Mischief</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/from-draenor-with-mischief/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2012 09:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/from-draenor-with-mischief/</guid><description>This is the special prize strip Cymre of Bubbles of Mischief won by taking 1st place in the Great Blog Noblegarden Egg Hunt!
Congratulations Cymre! We hope you enjoy your guest appearance!
Cymre maintains an amazing gallery of World of Warcraft rare spawns on her blog – aka, “Silver Dragons” – so we thought, hey, what better way to celebrate her egg-hunting victory than with some Silver Dragon love of her own?</description></item><item><title>Our Unsung Hero</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-unsung-hero/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2012 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/our-unsung-hero/</guid><description>From Draenor presents, Real Azerothian Geniuses.
Today we salute you, Mr. Lamp Hum Sound Creator Guy.
You work tirelessly to capture the tranquil sound of a summer breeze or the frantic buzz of fireflies trapped in a jar, just to make our weary trek through the wild a little less scary.
In the darkest of nights, we pause on our journey, wondering if that subtle rustling we just heard was one of your masterpieces singing its peaceful song of illumination, or a horrible flesh-eating zombie lurking in the bushes.</description></item><item><title>Maximum Cupacity</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/maximum-cupacity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2012 10:56:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/maximum-cupacity/</guid><description>I really, really wish we had ampm stores in Canada. I would totally buy those cups! The art on them looks great, and they’d be nice collectibles to own.
The three “rejected” cup ideas we came up with for this strip should all be sadly familiar to most WoW players. I don’t think anyone will EVER forget Sindragosa’s famous line, and Neptulon’s PUUUURE WATERRRR line from Throne of the Tides has quickly become a fan favorite.</description></item><item><title>Magic Touch</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/magic-touch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2012 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/magic-touch/</guid><description>…Then I finally found a suitable mold for the chassis or I thought it was a suitable chassis mold but actually they meant it for a gyrocopter and it wasn’t quite right so I tried to convince a friend to model for it but he wouldn’t because he said, and I quote, “Your inventions have a way of proving fatal to people who agree to test them,” I ask you, is that fair?</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Four</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-four/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2011 12:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-four/</guid><description>I wasn’t actually sure how Rades intended to end our little odyssey. Needless to say, my jaw dropped when I got this far in the script. It’s great for him, though, because he gets to show his mad genius! Vid, who has no compunction about blasting a rocket straight into Ironforge or any other environs, is a little uneasy when it comes to FrankenWinter. But ultimately, she decides that it’s better to let a cyborg version of Greatfather Winter do all of the Winter’s Veil stuff – so that she and Rades don’t have to.</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Three</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-three/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2011 02:40:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-three/</guid><description>Part 3 of 4! Rades and Vid do their best to fill the late Greatfather Winter’s shoes – in their own, unique fashion, of course.
Locations where Vid is now no longer permitted to operate: The Exodar AND Ironforge.
Hey, isn’t that rocket in panel 4 the same type as the one that blew up Greatfather Winter? Oh well, what those Druids don’t know, won’t hurt them…hopefully.
Next week’s Part 4 will come out a few days after Christmas, so consider it our special (belated) gift to you for reading!</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Two</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-two/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-two/</guid><description>The saga continues! Oh no, poor Greatfather Winter!
Vid did an awesome job with the expressions in this strip, I think you’ll all agree. I’m now using the “Sad Rades” face as my avatar, and I can’t even look at panel 3 without laughing.
There was some debate about which Greatfather Winter to use – the dwarven Alliance version, or the orcish Horde version! In the end though, we decided to go with the dwarf, to include more races.</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part One</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2011 07:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-one/</guid><description>It’s a cliche often used that “the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” In this case, a journey of approximately 17,500 miles per hour begins with a single rocket and a large explosion.
This is how engineers work.
Rades and I wanted to do something a little special and different for the upcoming holiday season, as well as try our hands at a mini story-arc! So expect this story to run for pretty much the rest of the month, until we reach its epic conclusion.</description></item><item><title>Transmogalypse</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/transmogalypse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/transmogalypse/</guid><description>Has there ever been a feature more eagerly anticipated than Transmogrification? If there is, I sure haven’t seen it. So many options! So much potential for nostalgia! The future has arrived, and its name is World of Dresscraft.
Of course, for every person who can’t wait to dig out their old Tier 1 or Tier 0.5 sets, there’s someone who is going to gleefully turn their fearsome, godly “I’m-About-to-Kill-Deathwing” armor into a neon nightmare Burning Crusade clown suit.</description></item><item><title>Yellow Angry Man</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/yellow-angry-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/yellow-angry-man/</guid><description>If you’ve played a paladin at level 85 for any length of time, hopefully this requires no explanation. For those of you who haven’t, well. Perhaps you play a melee DPS. You’re at the boss’ feet, stabbing/slicing/cutting (or whatever else it is that you melee folks do).
You hear an odd grunt.
“ARRRRGH!”
“GRRRRRR!”
“RRRRRAAA!”
This, my friends, is the Yellow, Angry Man. His anger knows no bounds. Likewise, his yellow-ness is unsurpassed.</description></item><item><title>Grudge Match</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/grudge-match/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2011 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/grudge-match/</guid><description>When the Pet Battle System was announced at Blizzcon, everyone had a wide range of reactions. Were they serious? Was this an elaborate joke? How much more like Pokemon could this possibly be? But without question, the most important possibility was the potential hilarity of absurd pet matchups, such as Alliance Balloon vs. Horde Balloon, or Enchanted Broom vs. Magic Lamp. Can you say EXCITEMENT??
Personally, I’m banking on my Toxic Wasteling.</description></item><item><title>Rare Spawn</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/rare-spawn-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2011 06:21:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/rare-spawn-3/</guid><description>I’m not especially good at keeping secrets. So the fact that you are only seeing this, now, after over a month of loving work is nothing short of a miracle. The idea of doing a webcomic wasn’t a new one for Rades and I – we’d talked about it before, sometime last year – but the time wasn’t right. We were on different pages about what a comic should be (I was thinking epic story, he was thinking gag) and so we just shelved it.</description></item></channel></rss>
