Seriously, there’s few things funnier than plopping down Blingtron in a hard-to-reach spot in a well-populated area and sitting back to watch people go MAD as they try to find that elusive free loot. My personal favorites include trees in Halfhill, the upper balconies in Pandalaran, or in the normally-inaccessible catwalk in Orgrimmar’s front auction house.
Thanks to Raijair, Kalbeari, Hachidori, Dhevon and Korrath for the use of your likenesses this week!</description></item><item><title>Magic Touch</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/magic-touch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2012 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/magic-touch/</guid><description>…Then I finally found a suitable mold for the chassis or I thought it was a suitable chassis mold but actually they meant it for a gyrocopter and it wasn’t quite right so I tried to convince a friend to model for it but he wouldn’t because he said, and I quote, “Your inventions have a way of proving fatal to people who agree to test them,” I ask you, is that fair?</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part Four</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-four/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2011 12:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-four/</guid><description>I wasn’t actually sure how Rades intended to end our little odyssey. Needless to say, my jaw dropped when I got this far in the script. It’s great for him, though, because he gets to show his mad genius! Vid, who has no compunction about blasting a rocket straight into Ironforge or any other environs, is a little uneasy when it comes to FrankenWinter. But ultimately, she decides that it’s better to let a cyborg version of Greatfather Winter do all of the Winter’s Veil stuff – so that she and Rades don’t have to.</description></item><item><title>Winter Fail Part One</title><link>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2011 07:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://fromdraenor.ca/comic/winter-fail-part-one/</guid><description>It’s a cliche often used that “the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” In this case, a journey of approximately 17,500 miles per hour begins with a single rocket and a large explosion.
This is how engineers work.
Rades and I wanted to do something a little special and different for the upcoming holiday season, as well as try our hands at a mini story-arc! So expect this story to run for pretty much the rest of the month, until we reach its epic conclusion.</description></item></channel></rss>
