I turned the joke into a single comic featuring my character Vidyala and the character of my friend Rades (aka Mike). I sent it to him to see if he thought it was funny, and whether he might like to do more comics with me.

You didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d wrap up our story without making Vid draw her favorite orc one last time, did you??
If you donâ€™t remember what Taran Zhu is referring to, it goes all the way back to the Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar trailer. Remember, the events of FDWL started when Siege of Orgrimmar began. And now, we examine the aftermath â€” of both stories.</description></item></channel></rss>
