Hope everyone is enjoying the season and holidays! Vid and I are both traveling for Christmas, so no new strip next week, but in the meantime enjoy this bit of FDWL holiday art! And <a href="/images/post-images/fdextra07_fullsize.jpg">click here to enjoy it full-size!</a>


In other exciting news, thank you to Rachel for being our latest Patreon supporter! With this, weâ€™ve now reached our milestone goal to have a monthly wallpaper each month for all of our patrons! So thatâ€™s something awesome to look forward to in 2015!  ðŸ˜€


Thank you to everyone whoâ€™s supported us and read the comic in 2014! We wish you the best this holiday season, and hope Robo-Greatfather Winter is generous! Weâ€™ll see you next year!
